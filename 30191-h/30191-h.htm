1</span>THE TOMB OF KEATS<br />
(<i>Irish Monthly</i>, July 1877.)</h2>
<p>As one enters Rome from the Via Ostiensis by the Porta San
Paolo, the first object that meets the eye is a marble pyramid
which stands close at hand on the left.</p>
<p>There are many Egyptian obelisks in Rome&mdash;tall, snakelike
spires of red sandstone, mottled with strange writings, which
remind us of the pillars of flame which led the children of
Israel through the desert away from the land of the Pharaohs; but
more wonderful than these to look upon is this gaunt,
wedge-shaped pyramid standing here in this Italian city,
unshattered amid the ruins and wrecks of time, looking older than
the Eternal City itself, like terrible impassiveness turned to
stone.&nbsp; And so in the Middle Ages men supposed this to be
the sepulchre of Remus, who was slain by his own brother at the
founding of the city, so ancient and mysterious it appears; but
we have now, perhaps unfortunately, more accurate information
about it, and know that it is the tomb of one Caius Cestius, a
Roman gentleman of small note, who died about 30 <span
class="smcap">b.c.</span></p>
<p>Yet though we cannot care much for the dead man who lies in
lonely state beneath it, and who is only known to the world
through his sepulchre, still this pyramid will be ever dear to
the eyes of all English-speaking people, because at evening its
shadows fall on the tomb of one who walks with Spenser, and
Shakespeare, and Byron, and Shelley, and Elizabeth Barrett
Browning in the great procession of the sweet singers of
England.</p>
<p>For at its foot there is a green sunny slope, known as the Old
Protestant Cemetery, and on this <!-- page 2--><a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>a
common-looking grave, which bears the following inscription:</p>
<blockquote><p>This grave contains all that was mortal of a young
English poet, who on his deathbed, in the bitterness of his
heart, desired these words to be engraven on his tombstone: <span
class="smcap">Here lies one whose name was writ in
water</span>.&nbsp; February 24, 1821.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the name of the young English poet is John Keats.</p>
<p>Lord Houghton calls this cemetery &lsquo;one of the most
beautiful spots on which the eye and heart of man can
rest,&rsquo; and Shelley speaks of it as making one &lsquo;in
love with death, to think that one should be buried in so sweet a
place&rsquo;; and indeed when I saw the violets and the daisies
and the poppies that overgrow the tomb, I remembered how the dead
poet had once told his friend that he thought the
&lsquo;intensest pleasure he had received in life was in watching
the growth of flowers,&rsquo; and how another time, after lying a
while quite still, he murmured in some strange prescience of
early death, &lsquo;I feel the flowers growing over
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But this time-worn stone and these wildflowers are but poor
memorials <a name="citation2"></a><a href="#footnote2"
class="citation">[2]</a> of one so great as Keats; most of all,
too, in this city of Rome, which pays <!-- page 3--><a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>such honour to
her dead; where popes, and emperors, and saints, and cardinals
lie hidden in &lsquo;porphyry wombs,&rsquo; or couched in baths
of jasper and chalcedony and malachite, ablaze with precious
stones and metals, and tended with continual service.&nbsp; For
very noble is the site, and worthy of a noble monument; behind
looms the grey pyramid, symbol of the world&rsquo;s age, and
filled with memories of the sphinx, and the lotus leaf, and the
glories of old Nile; in front is the Monte Testaccio, built, it
is said, with the broken fragments of the vessels in which all
the nations of the East and the West brought their tribute to
Rome; and a little distance off, along the slope of the hill
under the Aurelian wall, some tall gaunt cypresses rise, like
burnt-out funeral torches, to mark the spot where Shelley&rsquo;s
heart (that &lsquo;heart of hearts&rsquo;!) lies in the earth;
and, above all, the soil on which we tread is very Rome!</p>
<p>As I stood beside the mean grave of this divine boy, I thought
of him as of a Priest of Beauty slain before his time; and the
vision of Guido&rsquo;s St. Sebastian came before my eyes as I
saw him at Genoa, a lovely brown boy, with crisp, clustering hair
and red lips, bound by his evil enemies to a tree, and though
pierced by arrows, raising his eyes with divine, impassioned gaze
towards the Eternal Beauty of the opening heavens.&nbsp; And thus
my thoughts shaped themselves to rhyme:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">HEU MISERANDE PUER</p>
<p>Rid of the world&rsquo;s injustice and its pain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He rests at last beneath God&rsquo;s veil of
blue;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Taken from life while life and love were new<br />
The youngest of the martyrs here is lain,<br />
Fair as Sebastian and as foully slain.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No cypress shades his grave, nor funeral yew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But red-lipped daisies, violets drenched with
dew,<br />
And sleepy poppies, catch the evening rain.</p>
<p><!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>O proudest heart that broke for misery!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O saddest poet that the world hath seen!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O sweetest singer of the English
land!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy name was writ in water on the
sand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But our tears shall keep thy memory green,<br />
And make it flourish like a Basil-tree.</p>
<p><i>Rome</i>, 1877.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Note</i>.&mdash;A later version of this sonnet, under the
title of &lsquo;The Grave of Keats,&rsquo; is given in the
<i>Poems</i>, page 157.</p>
<h2>KEATS&rsquo;S SONNET ON BLUE<br />
(<i>Century Guild Hobby Horse</i>, July 1886.)</h2>
<p>During my tour in America I happened one evening to find
myself in Louisville, Kentucky.&nbsp; The subject I had selected
to speak on was the Mission of Art in the Nineteenth Century, and
in the course of my lecture I had occasion to quote Keats&rsquo;s
Sonnet on Blue as an example of the poet&rsquo;s delicate sense
of colour-harmonies.&nbsp; When my lecture was concluded there
came round to see me a lady of middle age, with a sweet gentle
manner and a most musical voice.&nbsp; She introduced herself to
me as Mrs. Speed, the daughter of George Keats, and invited me to
come and examine the Keats manuscripts in her possession.&nbsp; I
spent most of the next day with her, reading the letters of Keats
to her father, some of which were at that time unpublished,
poring over torn yellow leaves and faded scraps of paper, and
wondering at the little Dante in which Keats had written those
marvellous notes on Milton.&nbsp; Some months afterwards, when I
was in California, I received a letter from Mrs. Speed asking my
acceptance of the original manuscript of the sonnet which I had
quoted in my lecture.&nbsp; This manuscript <!-- page 5--><a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>I have had
reproduced here, as it seems to me to possess much psychological
interest.&nbsp; It shows us the conditions that preceded the
perfected form, the gradual growth, not of the conception but of
the expression, and the workings of that spirit of selection
which is the secret of style.&nbsp; In the case of poetry, as in
the case of the other arts, what may appear to be simply
technicalities of method are in their essence spiritual not
mechanical, and although, in all lovely work, what concerns us is
the ultimate form, not the conditions that necessitate that form,
yet the preference that precedes perfection, the evolution of the
beauty, and the mere making of the music, have, if not their
artistic value, at least their value to the artist.</p>
<p>It will be remembered that this sonnet was first published in
1848 by Lord Houghton in his <i>Life</i>, <i>Letters</i>, <i>and
Literary Remains of John Keats</i>.&nbsp; Lord Houghton does not
definitely state where he found it, but it was probably among the
Keats manuscripts belonging to Mr. Charles Brown.&nbsp; It is
evidently taken from a version later than that in my possession,
as it accepts all the corrections, and makes three
variations.&nbsp; As in my manuscript the first line is torn
away, I give the sonnet here as it appears in Lord
Houghton&rsquo;s edition.</p>
<blockquote><p>ANSWER TO A SONNET ENDING THUS:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark eyes are dearer
far<br />
Than those that make the hyacinthine bell. <a
name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5"
class="citation">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: right">By <span class="smcap">J. H.
Reynolds</span>.</p>
<p>Blue!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the life of heaven,&mdash;the domain<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Cynthia,&mdash;the wide palace of the
sun,&mdash;<br />
The tent of Hesperus and all his train,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The bosomer of clouds, gold, grey and dun.<br />
<!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>Blue!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the life of waters&mdash;ocean<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all its vassal streams: pools numberless<br />
May rage, and foam, and fret, but never can<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Subside if not to dark-blue nativeness.<br />
Blue! gentle cousin of the forest green,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Married to green in all the sweetest flowers,<br />
Forget-me-not,&mdash;the blue-bell,&mdash;and, that queen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of secrecy, the violet: what strange powers<br />
Hast thou, as a mere shadow!&nbsp; But how great,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When in an Eye thou art alive with fate!</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Feb.</i> 1818.</p>
<p>In the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> of the 3rd of June 1876 appeared
a letter from Mr. A. J. Horwood, stating that he had in his
possession a copy of <i>The Garden of Florence</i> in which this
sonnet was transcribed.&nbsp; Mr. Horwood, who was unaware that
the sonnet had been already published by Lord Houghton, gives the
transcript at length.&nbsp; His version reads <i>hue</i> for
<i>life</i> in the first line, and <i>bright</i> for <i>wide</i>
in the second, and gives the sixth line thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>With all his tributary streams, pools
numberless,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>a foot too long: it also reads <i>to</i> for <i>of</i> in the
ninth line.&nbsp; Mr. Buxton Forman is of opinion that these
variations are decidedly genuine, but indicative of an earlier
state of the poem than that adopted in Lord Houghton&rsquo;s
edition.&nbsp; However, now that we have before us Keats&rsquo;s
first draft of his sonnet, it is difficult to believe that the
sixth line in Mr. Horwood&rsquo;s version is really a genuine
variation.&nbsp; Keats may have written,</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ocean<br
/>
His tributary streams, pools numberless,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the transcript may have been carelessly made, but having
got his line right in his first draft, Keats probably did not
spoil it in his second.&nbsp; The <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> version
inserts a comma after <i>art</i> in the <!-- page 7--><a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>last line,
which seems to me a decided improvement, and eminently
characteristic of Keats&rsquo;s method.&nbsp; I am glad to see
that Mr. Buxton Forman has adopted it.</p>
<p>As for the corrections that Lord Houghton&rsquo;s version
shows Keats to have made in the eighth and ninth lines of this
sonnet, it is evident that they sprang from Keats&rsquo;s
reluctance to repeat the same word in consecutive lines, except
in cases where a word&rsquo;s music or meaning was to be
emphasized.&nbsp; The substitution of &lsquo;its&rsquo; for
&lsquo;his&rsquo; in the sixth line is more difficult of
explanation.&nbsp; It was due probably to a desire on
Keats&rsquo;s part not to mar by any echo the fine
personification of Hesperus.</p>
<p>It may be noticed that Keats&rsquo;s own eyes were brown, and
not blue, as stated by Mrs. Proctor to Lord Houghton.&nbsp; Mrs.
Speed showed me a note to that effect written by Mrs. George
Keats on the margin of the page in Lord Houghton&rsquo;s
<i>Life</i> (p. 100, vol. i.), where Mrs. Proctor&rsquo;s
description is given.&nbsp; Cowden Clarke made a similar
correction in his <i>Recollections</i>, and in some of the later
editions of Lord Houghton&rsquo;s book the word
&lsquo;blue&rsquo; is struck out.&nbsp; In Severn&rsquo;s
portraits of Keats also the eyes are given as brown.</p>
<p>The exquisite sense of colour expressed in the ninth and tenth
lines may be paralleled by</p>
<blockquote><p>The Ocean with its vastness, its blue green,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>of the sonnet to George Keats.</p>

8</span>DINNERS AND DISHES<br />
(<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, March 7, 1885.)</h2>
<p>A man can live for three days without bread, but no man can
live for one day without poetry, was an aphorism of
Baudelaire.&nbsp; You can live without pictures and music but you
cannot live without eating, says the author of <i>Dinners and
Dishes</i>; and this latter view is, no doubt, the more
popular.&nbsp; Who, indeed, in these degenerate days would
hesitate between an ode and an omelette, a sonnet and a
salmis?&nbsp; Yet the position is not entirely Philistine;
cookery is an art; are not its principles the subject of South
Kensington lectures, and does not the Royal Academy give a
banquet once a year?&nbsp; Besides, as the coming democracy will,
no doubt, insist on feeding us all on penny dinners, it is well
that the laws of cookery should be explained: for were the
national meal burned, or badly seasoned, or served up with the
wrong sauce a dreadful revolution might follow.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances we strongly recommend <i>Dinners and
Dishes</i> to every one: it is brief and concise and makes no
attempt at eloquence, which is extremely fortunate.&nbsp; For
even on ortolans who could endure oratory?&nbsp; It also has the
advantage of not being illustrated.&nbsp; The subject of a work
of art has, of course, nothing to do with its beauty, but still
there is always something depressing about the coloured
lithograph of a leg of mutton.</p>
<p>As regards the author&rsquo;s particular views, we entirely
agree with him on the important question of macaroni.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Never,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;ask me to back a <!-- page
9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>bill for
a man who has given me a macaroni pudding.&rsquo;&nbsp; Macaroni
is essentially a savoury dish and may be served with cheese or
tomatoes but never with sugar and milk.&nbsp; There is also a
useful description of how to cook risotto&mdash;a delightful dish
too rarely seen in England; an excellent chapter on the different
kinds of salads, which should be carefully studied by those many
hostesses whose imaginations never pass beyond lettuce and
beetroot; and actually a recipe for making Brussels sprouts
eatable.&nbsp; The last is, of course, a masterpiece.</p>
<p>The real difficulty that we all have to face in life is not so
much the science of cookery as the stupidity of cooks.&nbsp; And
in this little handbook to practical Epicureanism the tyrant of
the English kitchen is shown in her proper light.&nbsp; Her
entire ignorance of herbs, her passion for extracts and essences,
her total inability to make a soup which is anything more than a
combination of pepper and gravy, her inveterate habit of sending
up bread poultices with pheasants,&mdash;all these sins and many
others are ruthlessly unmasked by the author.&nbsp; Ruthlessly
and rightly.&nbsp; For the British cook is a foolish woman who
should be turned for her iniquities into a pillar of salt which
she never knows how to use.</p>
<p>But our author is not local merely.&nbsp; He has been in many
lands; he has eaten back-hendl at Vienna and kulibatsch at St.
Petersburg; he has had the courage to face the buffalo veal of
Roumania and to dine with a German family at one o&rsquo;clock;
he has serious views on the right method of cooking those famous
white truffles of Turin of which Alexandre Dumas was so fond;
and, in the face of the Oriental Club, declares that Bombay curry
is better than the <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>curry of Bengal.&nbsp; In fact he
seems to have had experience of almost every kind of meal except
the &lsquo;square meal&rsquo; of the Americans.&nbsp; This he
should study at once; there is a great field for the philosophic
epicure in the United States.&nbsp; Boston beans may be dismissed
at once as delusions, but soft-shell crabs, terrapin, canvas-back
ducks, blue fish and the pompono of New Orleans are all wonderful
delicacies, particularly when one gets them at
Delmonico&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Indeed, the two most remarkable bits of
scenery in the States are undoubtedly Delmonico&rsquo;s and the
Yosemit&eacute; Valley; and the former place has done more to
promote a good feeling between England and America than anything
else has in this century.</p>
<p>We hope the &lsquo;Wanderer&rsquo; will go there soon and add
a chapter to <i>Dinners and Dishes</i>, and that his book will
have in England the influence it deserves.&nbsp; There are twenty
ways of cooking a potato and three hundred and sixty-five ways of
cooking an egg, yet the British cook, up to the present moment,
knows only three methods of sending up either one or the
other.</p>

<h2>SHAKESPEARE ON SCENERY<br />
(<i>Dramatic Review</i>, March 14, 1885.)</h2>
<p>I have often heard people wonder what Shakespeare would say,
could he see Mr. Irving&rsquo;s production of his <i>Much Ado
About Nothing</i>, or Mr. Wilson Barrett&rsquo;s setting of his
<i>Hamlet</i>.&nbsp; Would he take pleasure in the glory of the
scenery and the marvel of the colour?&nbsp; Would he be
interested in the Cathedral of Messina, and the <!-- page 11--><a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>battlements
of Elsinore?&nbsp; Or would he be indifferent, and say the play,
and the play only, is the thing?</p>
<p>Speculations like these are always pleasurable, and in the
present case happen to be profitable also.&nbsp; For it is not
difficult to see what Shakespeare&rsquo;s attitude would be; not
difficult, that is to say, if one reads Shakespeare himself,
instead of reading merely what is written about him.</p>
<p>Speaking, for instance, directly, as the manager of a London
theatre, through the lips of the chorus in <i>Henry V.</i>, he
complains of the smallness of the stage on which he has to
produce the pageant of a big historical play, and of the want of
scenery which obliges him to cut out many of its most picturesque
incidents, apologises for the scanty number of supers who had to
play the soldiers, and for the shabbiness of the properties, and,
finally, expresses his regret at being unable to bring on real
horses.</p>
<p>In the <i>Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</i>, again, he gives
us a most amusing picture of the straits to which theatrical
managers of his day were reduced by the want of proper
scenery.&nbsp; In fact, it is impossible to read him without
seeing that he is constantly protesting against the two special
limitations of the Elizabethan stage&mdash;the lack of suitable
scenery, and the fashion of men playing women&rsquo;s parts, just
as he protests against other difficulties with which managers of
theatres have still to contend, such as actors who do not
understand their words; actors who miss their cues; actors who
overact their parts; actors who mouth; actors who gag; actors who
play to the gallery, and amateur actors.</p>
<p>And, indeed, a great dramatist, as he was, could not but have
felt very much hampered at being obliged continually to interrupt
the progress of a <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>play in order to send on some one to
explain to the audience that the scene was to be changed to a
particular place on the entrance of a particular character, and
after his exit to somewhere else; that the stage was to represent
the deck of a ship in a storm, or the interior of a Greek temple,
or the streets of a certain town, to all of which inartistic
devices Shakespeare is reduced, and for which he always amply
apologizes.&nbsp; Besides this clumsy method, Shakespeare had two
other substitutes for scenery&mdash;the hanging out of a placard,
and his descriptions.&nbsp; The first of these could hardly have
satisfied his passion for picturesqueness and his feeling for
beauty, and certainly did not satisfy the dramatic critic of his
day.&nbsp; But as regards the description, to those of us who
look on Shakespeare not merely as a playwright but as a poet, and
who enjoy reading him at home just as much as we enjoy seeing him
acted, it may be a matter of congratulation that he had not at
his command such skilled machinists as are in use now at the
Princess&rsquo;s and at the Lyceum.&nbsp; For had
Cleopatra&rsquo;s barge, for instance, been a structure of canvas
and Dutch metal, it would probably have been painted over or
broken up after the withdrawal of the piece, and, even had it
survived to our own day, would, I am afraid, have become
extremely shabby by this time.&nbsp; Whereas now the beaten gold
of its poop is still bright, and the purple of its sails still
beautiful; its silver oars are not tired of keeping time to the
music of the flutes they follow, nor the Nereid&rsquo;s
flower-soft hands of touching its silken tackle; the mermaid
still lies at its helm, and still on its deck stand the boys with
their coloured fans.&nbsp; Yet lovely as all Shakespeare&rsquo;s
descriptive passages are, a description is in its essence
undramatic.&nbsp; Theatrical audiences <!-- page 13--><a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>are far more
impressed by what they look at than by what they listen to; and
the modern dramatist, in having the surroundings of his play
visibly presented to the audience when the curtain rises, enjoys
an advantage for which Shakespeare often expresses his
desire.&nbsp; It is true that Shakespeare&rsquo;s descriptions
are not what descriptions are in modern plays&mdash;accounts of
what the audience can observe for themselves; they are the
imaginative method by which he creates in the mind of the
spectators the image of that which he desires them to see.&nbsp;
Still, the quality of the drama is action.&nbsp; It is always
dangerous to pause for picturesqueness.&nbsp; And the
introduction of self-explanatory scenery enables the modern
method to be far more direct, while the loveliness of form and
colour which it gives us, seems to me often to create an artistic
temperament in the audience, and to produce that joy in beauty
for beauty&rsquo;s sake, without which the great masterpieces of
art can never be understood, to which, and to which only, are
they ever revealed.</p>
<p>To talk of the passion of a play being hidden by the paint,
and of sentiment being killed by scenery, is mere emptiness and
folly of words.&nbsp; A noble play, nobly mounted, gives us
double artistic pleasure.&nbsp; The eye as well as the ear is
gratified, and the whole nature is made exquisitely receptive of
the influence of imaginative work.&nbsp; And as regards a bad
play, have we not all seen large audiences lured by the
loveliness of scenic effect into listening to rhetoric posing as
poetry, and to vulgarity doing duty for realism?&nbsp; Whether
this be good or evil for the public I will not here discuss, but
it is evident that the playwright, at any rate, never
suffers.</p>
<p>Indeed, the artist who really has suffered through the modern
mounting of plays is not the dramatist <!-- page 14--><a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>at all, but
the scene-painter proper.&nbsp; He is rapidly being displaced by
the stage-carpenter.&nbsp; Now and then, at Drury Lane, I have
seen beautiful old front cloths let down, as perfect as pictures
some of them, and pure painter&rsquo;s work, and there are many
which we all remember at other theatres, in front of which some
dialogue was reduced to graceful dumb-show through the hammer and
tin-tacks behind.&nbsp; But as a rule the stage is overcrowded
with enormous properties, which are not merely far more expensive
and cumbersome than scene-paintings, but far less beautiful, and
far less true.&nbsp; Properties kill perspective.&nbsp; A painted
door is more like a real door than a real door is itself, for the
proper conditions of light and shade can be given to it; and the
excessive use of built-up structures always makes the stage too
glaring, for as they have to be lit from behind, as well as from
the front, the gas-jets become the absolute light of the scene
instead of the means merely by which we perceive the conditions
of light and shadow which the painter has desired to show us.</p>
<p>So, instead of bemoaning the position of the playwright, it
were better for the critics to exert whatever influence they may
possess towards restoring the scene-painter to his proper
position as an artist, and not allowing him to be built over by
the property man, or hammered to death by the carpenter.&nbsp; I
have never seen any reason myself why such artists as Mr.
Beverley, Mr. Walter Hann, and Mr. Telbin should not be entitled
to become Academicians.&nbsp; They have certainly as good a claim
as have many of those R.A.&rsquo;s whose total inability to paint
we can see every May for a shilling.</p>
<p>And lastly, let those critics who hold up for our admiration
the simplicity of the Elizabethan stage <!-- page 15--><a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>remember that
they are lauding a condition of things against which Shakespeare
himself, in the spirit of a true artist, always strongly
protested.</p>
<h2><i>HENRY THE FOURTH</i> AT OXFORD<br />
(<i>Dramatic Review</i>, May 23, 1885.)</h2>
<p>I have been told that the ambition of every Dramatic Club is
to act <i>Henry IV</i>.&nbsp; I am not surprised.&nbsp; The
spirit of comedy is as fervent in this play as is the spirit of
chivalry; it is an heroic pageant as well as an heroic poem, and
like most of Shakespeare&rsquo;s historical dramas it contains an
extraordinary number of thoroughly good acting parts, each of
which is absolutely individual in character, and each of which
contributes to the evolution of the plot.</p>
<p>To Oxford belongs the honour of having been the first to
present on the stage this noble play, and the production which I
saw last week was in every way worthy of that lovely town, that
mother of sweetness and of light.&nbsp; For, in spite of the
roaring of the young lions at the Union, and the screaming of the
rabbits in the home of the vivisector, in spite of Keble College,
and the tramways, and the sporting prints, Oxford still remains
the most beautiful thing in England, and nowhere else are life
and art so exquisitely blended, so perfectly made one.&nbsp;
Indeed, in most other towns art has often to present herself in
the form of a reaction against the sordid ugliness of ignoble
lives, but at Oxford she comes to us as an exquisite flower born
of the beauty of life and expressive of life&rsquo;s joy.&nbsp;
She finds her home by the Isis as once she did by the Ilissus;
the Magdalen <!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>walks and the Magdalen cloisters are
as dear to her as were ever the silver olives of Colonus and the
golden gateway of the house of Pallas: she covers with fanlike
tracery the vaulted entrance to Christ Church Hall, and looks out
from the windows of Merton; her feet have stirred the Cumnor
cowslips, and she gathers fritillaries in the river-fields.&nbsp;
To her the clamour of the schools and the dullness of the
lecture-room are a weariness and a vexation of spirit; she seeks
not to define virtue, and cares little for the categories; she
smiles on the swift athlete whose plastic grace has pleased her,
and rejoices in the young Barbarians at their games; she watches
the rowers from the reedy bank and gives myrtle to her lovers,
and laurels to her poets, and rue to those who talk wisely in the
street; she makes the earth lovely to all who dream with Keats;
she opens high heaven to all who soar with Shelley; and turning
away her head from pedant, proctor and Philistine, she has
welcomed to her shrine a band of youthful actors, knowing that
they have sought with much ardour for the stern secret of
Melpomene, and caught with much gladness the sweet laughter of
Thalia.&nbsp; And to me this ardour and this gladness were the
two most fascinating qualities of the Oxford performance, as
indeed they are qualities which are necessary to any fine
dramatic production.&nbsp; For without quick and imaginative
observation of life the most beautiful play becomes dull in
presentation, and what is not conceived in delight by the actor
can give no delight at all to others.</p>
<p>I know that there are many who consider that Shakespeare is
more for the study than for the stage.&nbsp; With this view I do
not for a moment agree.&nbsp; Shakespeare wrote the plays to be
acted, and we have no right to alter the form which he himself
selected for <!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>the full expression of his
work.&nbsp; Indeed, many of the beauties of that work can be
adequately conveyed to us only through the actor&rsquo;s
art.&nbsp; As I sat in the Town Hall of Oxford the other night,
the majesty of the mighty lines of the play seemed to me to gain
new music from the clear young voices that uttered them, and the
ideal grandeur of the heroism to be made more real to the
spectators by the chivalrous bearing, the noble gesture and the
fine passion of its exponents.&nbsp; Even the dresses had their
dramatic value.&nbsp; Their arch&aelig;ological accuracy gave us,
immediately on the rise of the curtain, a perfect picture of the
time.&nbsp; As the knights and nobles moved across the stage in
the flowing robes of peace and in the burnished steel of battle,
we needed no dreary chorus to tell us in what age or land the
play&rsquo;s action was passing, for the fifteenth century in all
the dignity and grace of its apparel was living actually before
us, and the delicate harmonies of colour struck from the first a
dominant note of beauty which added to the intellectual realism
of arch&aelig;ology the sensuous charm of art.</p>
<p>I have rarely seen a production better stage-managed.&nbsp;
Indeed, I hope that the University will take some official notice
of this delightful work of art.&nbsp; Why should not degrees be
granted for good acting?&nbsp; Are they not given to those who
misunderstand Plato and who mistranslate Aristotle?&nbsp; And
should the artist be passed over?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; To Prince Hal,
Hotspur and Falstaff, D.C.L.&rsquo;s should be gracefully
offered.&nbsp; I feel sure they would be gracefully
accepted.&nbsp; To the rest of the company the crimson or the
sheepskin hood might be assigned <i>honoris caus&acirc;</i> to
the eternal confusion of the Philistine, and the rage of the
industrious and the dull.&nbsp; Thus would Oxford confer honour
on herself, and <!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>the artist be placed in his proper
position.&nbsp; However, whether or not Convocation recognizes
the claims of culture, I hope that the Oxford Dramatic Society
will produce every summer for us some noble play like <i>Henry
IV</i>.&nbsp; For, in plays of this kind, plays which deal with
bygone times, there is always this peculiar charm, that they
combine in one exquisite presentation the passions that are
living with the picturesqueness that is dead.&nbsp; And when we
have the modern spirit given to us in an antique form, the very
remoteness of that form can be made a method of increased
realism.&nbsp; This was Shakespeare&rsquo;s own attitude towards
the ancient world, this is the attitude we in this century should
adopt towards his plays, and with a feeling akin to this it
seemed to me that these brilliant young Oxonians were
working.&nbsp; If it was so, their aim is the right one.&nbsp;
For while we look to the dramatist to give romance to realism, we
ask of the actor to give realism to romance.</p>
<h2>A HANDBOOK TO MARRIAGE<br />
(<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, November 18, 1885.)</h2>
<p>In spite of its somewhat alarming title this book may be
highly recommended to every one.&nbsp; As for the authorities the
author quotes, they are almost numberless, and range from
Socrates down to Artemus Ward.&nbsp; He tells us of the wicked
bachelor who spoke of marriage as &lsquo;a very harmless
amusement&rsquo; and advised a young friend of his to
&lsquo;marry early and marry often&rsquo;; of Dr. Johnson who
proposed that marriage should be arranged by the Lord Chancellor,
without the parties concerned <!-- page 19--><a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>having any
choice in the matter; of the Sussex labourer who asked,
&lsquo;Why should I give a woman half my victuals for cooking the
other half?&rsquo; and of Lord Verulam who thought that unmarried
men did the best public work.&nbsp; And, indeed, marriage is the
one subject on which all women agree and all men disagree.&nbsp;
Our author, however, is clearly of the same opinion as the Scotch
lassie who, on her father warning her what a solemn thing it was
to get married, answered, &lsquo;I ken that, father, but
it&rsquo;s a great deal solemner to be single.&rsquo;&nbsp; He
may be regarded as the champion of the married life.&nbsp;
Indeed, he has a most interesting chapter on marriage-made men,
and though he dissents, and we think rightly, from the view
recently put forward by a lady or two on the Women&rsquo;s Rights
platform that Solomon owed all his wisdom to the number of his
wives, still he appeals to Bismarck, John Stuart Mill, Mahommed,
and Lord Beaconsfield, as instances of men whose success can be
traced to the influence of the women they married.&nbsp;
Archbishop Whately once defined woman as &lsquo;a creature that
does not reason and pokes the fire from the top,&rsquo; but since
his day the higher education of women has considerably altered
their position.&nbsp; Women have always had an emotional sympathy
with those they love; Girton and Newnham have rendered
intellectual sympathy also possible.&nbsp; In our day it is best
for a man to be married, and men must give up the tyranny in
married life which was once so dear to them, and which, we are
afraid, lingers still, here and there.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you wish to be my wife, Mabel?&rsquo; said a little
boy.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; incautiously answered Mabel.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Then pull off my boots.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On marriage vows our author has, too, very sensible <!-- page
20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>views
and very amusing stories.&nbsp; He tells of a nervous bridegroom
who, confusing the baptismal and marriage ceremonies, replied
when asked if he consented to take the bride for his wife:
&lsquo;I renounce them all&rsquo;; of a Hampshire rustic who,
when giving the ring, said solemnly to the bride: &lsquo;With my
body I thee wash up, and with all my hurdle goods I thee and
thou&rsquo;; of another who when asked whether he would take his
partner to be his wedded wife, replied with shameful indecision:
&lsquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m willin&rsquo;; but I&rsquo;d a sight rather
have her sister&rsquo;; and of a Scotch lady who, on the occasion
of her daughter&rsquo;s wedding, was asked by an old friend
whether she might congratulate her on the event, and answered:
&lsquo;Yes, yes, upon the whole it is very satisfactory; it is
true Jeannie hates her gudeman, but then there&rsquo;s always a
something!&rsquo;&nbsp; Indeed, the good stories contained in
this book are quite endless and make it very pleasant reading,
while the good advice is on all points admirable.</p>
<p>Most young married people nowadays start in life with a
dreadful collection of ormolu inkstands covered with sham onyxes,
or with a perfect museum of salt-cellars.&nbsp; We strongly
recommend this book as one of the best of wedding presents.&nbsp;
It is a complete handbook to an earthly Paradise, and its author
may be regarded as the Murray of matrimony and the Baedeker of
bliss.</p>

<h2><!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>TO READ OR NOT TO READ<br />
(<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, February 8, 1886.)</h2>
<p>Books, I fancy, may be conveniently divided into three
classes:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Books to read, such as Cicero&rsquo;s <i>Letters</i>,
Suetonius, Vasari&rsquo;s <i>Lives of the Painters</i>, the
<i>Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini</i>, Sir John Mandeville,
Marco Polo, St. Simon&rsquo;s <i>Memoirs</i>, Mommsen, and (till
we get a better one) Grote&rsquo;s <i>History of Greece</i>.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Books to re-read, such as Plato and Keats: in the
sphere of poetry, the masters not the minstrels; in the sphere of
philosophy, the seers not the <i>savants</i>.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Books not to read at all, such as Thomson&rsquo;s
<i>Seasons</i>, Rogers&rsquo;s <i>Italy</i>, Paley&rsquo;s
<i>Evidences</i>, all the Fathers except St. Augustine, all John
Stuart Mill except the essay on <i>Liberty</i>, all
Voltaire&rsquo;s plays without any exception, Butler&rsquo;s
<i>Analogy</i>, Grant&rsquo;s <i>Aristotle</i>, Hume&rsquo;s
<i>England</i>, Lewes&rsquo;s <i>History of Philosophy</i>, all
argumentative books and all books that try to prove anything.</p>
<p>The third class is by far the most important.&nbsp; To tell
people what to read is, as a rule, either useless or harmful;
for, the appreciation of literature is a question of temperament
not of teaching; to Parnassus there is no primer and nothing that
one can learn is ever worth learning.&nbsp; But to tell people
what not to read is a very different matter, and I venture to
recommend it as a mission to the University Extension Scheme.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is one that is eminently needed in this age of
ours, an age that reads so much, that it has no time to admire,
and writes so much, that it has no time to think.&nbsp; Whoever
will select out of the <!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>chaos of our modern curricula
&lsquo;The Worst Hundred Books,&rsquo; and publish a list of
them, will confer on the rising generation a real and lasting
benefit.</p>
<p>After expressing these views I suppose I should not offer any
suggestions at all with regard to &lsquo;The Best Hundred
Books,&rsquo; but I hope you will allow me the pleasure of being
inconsistent, as I am anxious to put in a claim for a book that
has been strangely omitted by most of the excellent judges who
have contributed to your columns.&nbsp; I mean the <i>Greek
Anthology</i>.&nbsp; The beautiful poems contained in this
collection seem to me to hold the same position with regard to
Greek dramatic literature as do the delicate little figurines of
Tanagra to the Phidian marbles, and to be quite as necessary for
the complete understanding of the Greek spirit.</p>
<p>I am also amazed to find that Edgar Allan Poe has been passed
over.&nbsp; Surely this marvellous lord of rhythmic expression
deserves a place?&nbsp; If, in order to make room for him, it be
necessary to elbow out some one else, I should elbow out Southey,
and I think that Baudelaire might be most advantageously
substituted for Keble.</p>
<p>No doubt, both in the <i>Curse of Kehama</i> and in the
<i>Christian Year</i> there are poetic qualities of a certain
kind, but absolute catholicity of taste is not without its
dangers.&nbsp; It is only an auctioneer who should admire all
schools of art.</p>
<h2>THE LETTERS OF A GREAT WOMAN<br />
(<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, March 6, 1886.)</h2>
<p>Of the many collections of letters that have appeared in this
century few, if any, can rival for fascination of style and
variety of incident <!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>the letters of George Sand which have
recently been translated into English by M. Ledos de
Beaufort.&nbsp; They extend over a space of more than sixty
years, from 1812 to 1876, in fact, and comprise the first letters
of Aurore Dupin, a child of eight years old, as well as the last
letters of George Sand, a woman of seventy-two.&nbsp; The very
early letters, those of the child and of the young married woman,
possess, of course, merely a psychological interest; but from
1831, the date of Madame Dudevant&rsquo;s separation from her
husband and her first entry into Paris life, the interest becomes
universal, and the literary and political history of France is
mirrored in every page.</p>
<p>For George Sand was an indefatigable correspondent; she longs
in one of her letters, it is true, for &lsquo;a planet where
reading and writing are absolutely unknown,&rsquo; but still she
had a real pleasure in letter-writing.&nbsp; Her greatest delight
was the communication of ideas, and she is always in the heart of
the battle.&nbsp; She discusses pauperism with Louis Napoleon in
his prison at Ham, and liberty with Armand Barbes in his dungeon
at Vincennes; she writes to Lamennais on philosophy, to Mazzini
on socialism, to Lamartine on democracy, and to Ledru-Rollin on
justice.&nbsp; Her letters reveal to us not merely the life of a
great novelist but the soul of a great woman, of a woman who was
one with all the noblest movements of her day and whose sympathy
with humanity was boundless absolutely.&nbsp; For the aristocracy
of intellect she had always the deepest veneration, but the
democracy of suffering touched her more.&nbsp; She preached the
regeneration of mankind, not with the noisy ardour of the paid
advocate, but with the enthusiasm of the true evangelist.&nbsp;
Of all the <!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>artists of this century she was the
most altruistic; she felt every one&rsquo;s misfortunes except
her own.&nbsp; Her faith never left her; to the end of her life,
as she tells us, she was able to believe without illusions.&nbsp;
But the people disappointed her a little.&nbsp; She saw that they
followed persons not principles, and for &lsquo;the great man
theory&rsquo; George Sand had no respect.&nbsp; &lsquo;Proper
names are the enemies of principles&rsquo; is one of her
aphorisms.</p>
<p>So from 1850 her letters are more distinctly literary.&nbsp;
She discusses modern realism with Flaubert, and play-writing with
Dumas <i>fils</i>; and protests with passionate vehemence against
the doctrine of <i>L&rsquo;art pour l&rsquo;art</i>.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Art for the sake of itself is an idle sentence,&rsquo; she
writes; &lsquo;art for the sake of truth, for the sake of what is
beautiful and good, that is the creed I seek.&rsquo;&nbsp; And in
a delightful letter to M. Charles Poncy she repeats the same idea
very charmingly.&nbsp; &lsquo;People say that birds sing for the
sake of singing, but I doubt it.&nbsp; They sing their loves and
happiness, and in that they are in keeping with nature.&nbsp; But
man must do something more, and poets only sing in order to move
people and to make them think.&rsquo;&nbsp; She wanted M. Poncy
to be the poet of the people and, if good advice were all that
had been needed, he would certainly have been the Burns of the
workshop.&nbsp; She drew out a delightful scheme for a volume to
be called <i>Songs of all Trades</i> and saw the possibilities of
making handicrafts poetic.&nbsp; Perhaps she valued good
intentions in art a little too much, and she hardly understood
that art for art&rsquo;s sake is not meant to express the final
cause of art but is merely a formula of creation; but, as she
herself had scaled Parnassus, we must not quarrel at her bringing
Proletarianism with her.&nbsp; For George Sand must <!-- page
25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>be
ranked among our poetic geniuses.&nbsp; She regarded the novel as
still within the domain of poetry.&nbsp; Her heroes are not dead
photographs; they are great possibilities.&nbsp; Modern novels
are dissections; hers are dreams.&nbsp; &lsquo;I make popular
types,&rsquo; she writes, &lsquo;such as I do no longer see, but
such as they should and might be.&rsquo;&nbsp; For realism, in M.
Zola&rsquo;s acceptation of the word, she had no
admiration.&nbsp; Art to her was a mirror that transfigured
truths but did not represent realities.&nbsp; Hence she could not
understand art without personality.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am
aware,&rsquo; she writes to Flaubert, &lsquo;that you are opposed
to the exposition of personal doctrine in literature.&nbsp; Are
you right?&nbsp; Does not your opposition proceed rather from a
want of conviction than from a principle of
&aelig;sthetics?&nbsp; If we have any philosophy in our brain it
must needs break forth in our writings.&nbsp; But you, as soon as
you handle literature, you seem anxious, I know not why, to be
another man, the one who must disappear, who annihilates himself
and is no more.&nbsp; What a singular mania!&nbsp; What a
deficient taste!&nbsp; The worth of our productions depends
entirely on our own.&nbsp; Besides, if we withhold our own
opinions respecting the personages we create, we naturally leave
the reader in uncertainty as to the opinion he should himself
form of them.&nbsp; That amounts to wishing not to be understood,
and the result of this is that the reader gets weary of us and
leaves us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She herself, however, may be said to have suffered from too
dominant a personality, and this was the reason of the failure of
most of her plays.</p>
<p>Of the drama in the sense of disinterested presentation she
had no idea, and what is the strength and life-blood of her
novels is the weakness of her <!-- page 26--><a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>dramatic
works.&nbsp; But in the main she was right.&nbsp; Art without
personality is impossible.&nbsp; And yet the aim of art is not to
reveal personality, but to please.&nbsp; This she hardly
recognized in her &aelig;sthetics, though she realized it in her
work.&nbsp; On literary style she has some excellent
remarks.&nbsp; She dislikes the extravagances of the romantic
school and sees the beauty of simplicity.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Simplicity,&rsquo; she writes, &lsquo;is the most
difficult thing to secure in this world: it is the last limit of
experience and the last effort of genius.&rsquo;&nbsp; She hated
the slang and <i>argot</i> of Paris life, and loved the words
used by the peasants in the provinces.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
provinces,&rsquo; she remarks, &lsquo;preserve the tradition of
the original tongue and create but few new words.&nbsp; I feel
much respect for the language of the peasantry; in my estimation
it is the more correct.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She thought Flaubert too much preoccupied with the sense of
form, and makes these excellent observations to him&mdash;perhaps
her best piece of literary criticism.&nbsp; &lsquo;You consider
the form as the aim, whereas it is but the effect.&nbsp; Happy
expressions are only the outcome of emotion and emotion itself
proceeds from a conviction.&nbsp; We are only moved by that which
we ardently believe in.&rsquo;&nbsp; Literary schools she
distrusted.&nbsp; Individualism was to her the keystone of art as
well as of life.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do not belong to any school: do not
imitate any model,&rsquo; is her advice.&nbsp; Yet she never
encouraged eccentricity.&nbsp; &lsquo;Be correct,&rsquo; she
writes to Eug&egrave;ne Pelletan, &lsquo;that is rarer than being
eccentric, as the time goes.&nbsp; It is much more common to
please by bad taste than to receive the cross of
honour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On the whole, her literary advice is sound and healthy.&nbsp;
She never shrieks and she never sneers.&nbsp; She is the
incarnation of good sense.&nbsp; And the <!-- page 27--><a

collection of her letters is a perfect treasure-house of
suggestions both on art and on politics.</p>

<h2>B&Eacute;RANGER IN ENGLAND<br />
(<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, April 21, 1886.)</h2>
<p>A philosophic politician once remarked that the best possible
form of government is an absolute monarchy tempered by street
ballads.</p>
<p>Without at all agreeing with this aphorism we still cannot but
regret that the new democracy does not use poetry as a means for
the expression of political opinion.&nbsp; The Socialists, it is
true, have been heard singing the later poems of Mr. William
Morris, but the street ballad is really dead in England.&nbsp;
The fact is that most modern poetry is so artificial in its form,
so individual in its essence and so literary in its style, that
the people as a body are little moved by it, and when they have
grievances against the capitalist or the aristocrat they prefer
strikes to sonnets and rioting to rondels.</p>
<p>Possibly, Mr. William Toynbee&rsquo;s pleasant little volume
of translations from B&eacute;ranger may be the herald of a new
school.&nbsp; B&eacute;ranger had all the qualifications for a
popular poet.&nbsp; He wrote to be sung more than to be read; he
preferred the Pont Neuf to Parnassus; he was patriotic as well as
romantic, and humorous as well as humane.&nbsp; Translations of
poetry as a rule are merely misrepresentations, but the muse of
B&eacute;ranger is so simple and na&iuml;ve that she can wear our
English dress with ease <!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>and grace, and Mr. Toynbee has kept
much of the mirth and music of the original.&nbsp; Here and
there, undoubtedly, the translation could be improved upon;
&lsquo;rapiers&rsquo; for instance is an abominable rhyme to
&lsquo;forefathers&rsquo;; &lsquo;the hated arms of Albion&rsquo;
in the same poem is a very feeble rendering of &lsquo;le
l&eacute;opard de l&rsquo;Anglais,&rsquo; and such a verse as</p>
<blockquote><p>&rsquo;Mid France&rsquo;s miracles of art,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rare trophies won from art&rsquo;s own land,<br />
I&rsquo;ve lived to see with burning heart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The fog-bred poor triumphant stand,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>reproduces very inadequately the charm of the original:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dans nos palais, o&ugrave;, pr&egrave;s de la
victoire,<br />
Brillaient les arts, doux fruits des beaux climats,<br />
J&rsquo;ai vu du Nord les peuplades sans gloire,<br />
De leurs manteaux secouer les frimas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the whole, however, Mr. Toynbee&rsquo;s work is good;
<i>Les Champs</i>, for example, is very well translated, and so
are the two delightful poems <i>Rosette</i> and <i>Ma
R&eacute;publique</i>; and there is a good deal of spirit in
<i>Le Marquis de Carabas</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Whom have we here in conqueror&rsquo;s
<i>r&ocirc;le</i>?<br />
Our grand old marquis, bless his soul!<br />
Whose grand old charger (mark his bone!)<br />
Has borne him back to claim his own.<br />
Note, if you please, the grand old style<br />
In which he nears his grand old pile;<br />
With what an air of grand old state<br />
He waves that blade immaculate!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hats off, hats off, for my lord to pass,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The grand old Marquis of Carabas!&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>though &lsquo;that blade immaculate&rsquo; has hardly got the
sting of &lsquo;un sabre innocent&rsquo;; and in the fourth verse
of the same poem, &lsquo;Marquise, you&rsquo;ll have the
bed-chamber&rsquo; does not very clearly convey the sense of the
line &lsquo;La Marquise a le tabouret.&rsquo;&nbsp;
B&eacute;ranger <!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>is not nearly well enough known in
England, and though it is always better to read a poet in the
original, still translations have their value as echoes have
their music.</p>

<h2>THE POETRY OF THE PEOPLE<br />
(<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, May 13, 1886.)</h2>
<p>The Countess Martinengo deserves well of all poets, peasants
and publishers.&nbsp; Folk-lore is so often treated nowadays
merely from the point of view of the comparative mythologist,
that it is really delightful to come across a book that deals
with the subject simply as literature.&nbsp; For the Folk-tale is
the father of all fiction as the Folk-song is the mother of all
poetry; and in the games, the tales and the ballads of primitive
people it is easy to see the germs of such perfected forms of art
as the drama, the novel and the epic.&nbsp; It is, of course,
true that the highest expression of life is to be found not in
the popular songs, however poetical, of any nation, but in the
great masterpieces of self-conscious Art; yet it is pleasant
sometimes to leave the summit of Parnassus to look at the
wildflowers in the valley, and to turn from the lyre of Apollo to
listen to the reed of Pan.&nbsp; We can still listen to it.&nbsp;
To this day, the vineyard dressers of Calabria will mock the
passer-by with satirical verses as they used to do in the old
pagan days, and the peasants of the olive woods of Provence
answer each other in am&oelig;b&aelig;an strains.&nbsp; The
Sicilian shepherd has not yet thrown his pipe <!-- page 30--><a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>aside, and
the children of modern Greece sing the swallow-song through the
villages in spring-time, though Theognis is more than two
thousand years dead.&nbsp; Nor is this popular poetry merely the
rhythmic expression of joy and sorrow; it is in the highest
degree imaginative; and taking its inspiration directly from
nature it abounds in realistic metaphor and in picturesque and
fantastic imagery.&nbsp; It must, of course, be admitted that
there is a conventionality of nature as there is a
conventionality of art, and that certain forms of utterance are
apt to become stereotyped by too constant use; yet, on the whole,
it is impossible not to recognize in the Folk-songs that the
Countess Martinengo has brought together one strong dominant note
of fervent and flawless sincerity.&nbsp; Indeed, it is only in
the more terrible dramas of the Elizabethan age that we can find
any parallel to the Corsican <i>voceri</i> with their shrill
intensity of passion, their awful frenzies of grief and
hate.&nbsp; And yet, ardent as the feeling is, the form is nearly
always beautiful.&nbsp; Now and then, in the poems of the extreme
South one meets with a curious crudity of realism, but, as a
rule, the sense of beauty prevails.</p>
<p>Some of the Folk-poems in this book have all the lightness and
loveliness of lyrics, all of them have that sweet simplicity of
pure song by which mirth finds its own melody and mourning its
own music, and even where there are conceits of thought and
expression they are conceits born of fancy not of
affectation.&nbsp; Herrick himself might have envied that
wonderful love-song of Provence:</p>
<blockquote><p>If thou wilt be the falling dew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And fall on me alway,<br />
Then I will be the white, white rose<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On yonder thorny spray.<br />
<!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>If thou wilt be the white, white rose<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On yonder thorny spray,<br />
Then I will be the honey-bee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And kiss thee all the day.</p>
<p>If thou wilt be the honey-bee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And kiss me all the day,<br />
Then I will be in yonder heaven<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The star of brightest ray.<br />
If thou wilt be in yonder heaven<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The star of brightest ray,<br />
Then I will be the dawn, and we<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall meet at break of day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How charming also is this lullaby by which the Corsican mother
sings her babe to sleep!</p>
<blockquote><p>Gold and pearls my vessel lade,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Silk and cloth the cargo be,<br />
All the sails are of brocade<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Coming from beyond the sea;<br />
And the helm of finest gold,<br />
Made a wonder to behold.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fast awhile in slumber lie;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sleep, my child, and hushaby.</p>
<p>After you were born full soon,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You were christened all aright;<br />
Godmother she was the moon,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Godfather the sun so bright.<br />
All the stars in heaven told<br />
Wore their necklaces of gold.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fast awhile in slumber lie;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sleep, my child, and hushaby.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or this from Roumania:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sleep, my daughter, sleep an hour;<br />
Mother&rsquo;s darling gilliflower.<br />
Mother rocks thee, standing near,<br />
She will wash thee in the clear<br />
Waters that from fountains run,<br />
To protect thee from the sun.</p>
<p>Sleep, my darling, sleep an hour,<br />
Grow thou as the gilliflower.<br />
As a tear-drop be thou white,<br />
As a willow tall and slight;<br />
Gentle as the ring-doves are,<br />
And be lovely as a star!</p>

<p>The Countess Martinengo has certainly given us a most
fascinating book.&nbsp; In a volume of moderate dimensions, not
too long to be tiresome nor too brief to be disappointing, she
has collected together the best examples of modern Folk-songs,
and with her as a guide the lazy reader lounging in his armchair
may wander from the melancholy pine-forests of the North to
Sicily&rsquo;s orange-groves and the pomegranate gardens of
Armenia, and listen to the singing of those to whom poetry is a
passion, not a profession, and whose art, coming from inspiration
and not from schools, if it has the limitations, at least has
also the loveliness of its origin, and is one with blowing
grasses and the flowers of the field.</p>

<h2><i>THE CENCI</i><br />
(<i>Dramatic Review</i>, May 15, 1886.)</h2>
<p>The production of <i>The Cenci</i> last week at the Grand
Theatre, Islington, may be said to have been an era in the
literary history of this century, and the Shelley Society
deserves the highest praise and warmest thanks of all for having
given us an opportunity of seeing Shelley&rsquo;s play under the
conditions he himself desired for it.&nbsp; For <i>The Cenci</i>
was written absolutely with a view to theatric presentation, and
had Shelley&rsquo;s own wishes been carried out it would have
been produced during his lifetime at Covent Garden, with Edmund
<!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>Kean and Miss O&rsquo;Neill in the principal
parts.&nbsp; In working out his conception, Shelley had studied
very carefully the &aelig;sthetics of dramatic art.&nbsp; He saw
that the essence of the drama is disinterested presentation, and
that the characters must not be merely mouthpieces for splendid
poetry but must be living subjects for terror and for pity.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I have endeavoured,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;as nearly as
possible to represent the characters as they probably were, and
have sought to avoid the error of making them actuated by my own
conception of right or wrong, false or true: thus under a thin
veil converting names and actions of the sixteenth century into
cold impersonations of my own mind. . . .</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have avoided with great care the introduction of what
is commonly called mere poetry, and I imagine there will scarcely
be found a detached simile or a single isolated description,
unless Beatrice&rsquo;s description of the chasm appointed for
her father&rsquo;s murder should be judged to be of that
nature.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He recognized that a dramatist must be allowed far greater
freedom of expression than what is conceded to a poet.&nbsp;
&lsquo;In a dramatic composition,&rsquo; to use his own words,
&lsquo;the imagery and the passion should interpenetrate one
another, the former being reserved simply for the full
development and illustration of the latter.&nbsp; Imagination is
as the immortal God which should assume flesh for the redemption
of mortal passion.&nbsp; It is thus that the most remote and the
most familiar imagery may alike be fit for dramatic purposes when
employed in the illustration of strong feeling, which raises what
is low, and levels to the apprehension that which is lofty,
casting over all the shadow of its own greatness.&nbsp; In other
respects I have written <!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>more carelessly, that is, without an
over-fastidious and learned choice of words.&nbsp; In this
respect I entirely agree with those modern critics who assert
that in order to move men to true sympathy we must use the
familiar language of men.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He knew that if the dramatist is to teach at all it must be by
example, not by precept.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The highest moral purpose,&rsquo; he remarks,
&lsquo;aimed at in the highest species of the drama, is the
teaching the human heart, through its sympathies and antipathies,
the knowledge of itself; in proportion to the possession of which
knowledge every human being is wise, just, sincere, tolerant and
kind.&nbsp; If dogmas can do more it is well: but a drama is no
fit place for the enforcement of them.&rsquo;&nbsp; He fully
realizes that it is by a conflict between our artistic sympathies
and our moral judgment that the greatest dramatic effects are
produced.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is in the restless and anatomizing
casuistry with which men seek the justification of Beatrice, yet
feel that she has done what needs justification; it is in the
superstitious horror with which they contemplate alike her wrongs
and their revenge, that the dramatic character of what she did
and suffered consists.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In fact no one has more clearly understood than Shelley the
mission of the dramatist and the meaning of the drama.</p>
<h2>BALZAC IN ENGLISH<br />
(<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, September 13, 1886.)</h2>
<p>Many years ago, in a number of <i>All the Year Round</i>,
Charles Dickens complained that Balzac was very little read in
England, and although since then the public has become more <!--
page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>familiar with the great masterpieces of French fiction,
still it may be doubted whether the <i>Com&eacute;die Humaine</i>
is at all appreciated or understood by the general run of novel
readers.&nbsp; It is really the greatest monument that literature
has produced in our century, and M. Taine hardly exaggerates when
he says that, after Shakespeare, Balzac is our most important
magazine of documents on human nature.&nbsp; Balzac&rsquo;s aim,
in fact, was to do for humanity what Buffon had done for the
animal creation.&nbsp; As the naturalist studied lions and
tigers, so the novelist studied men and women.&nbsp; Yet he was
no mere reporter.&nbsp; Photography and
<i>proc&egrave;s-verbal</i> were not the essentials of his
method.&nbsp; Observation gave him the facts of life, but his
genius converted facts into truths, and truths into truth.&nbsp;
He was, in a word, a marvellous combination of the artistic
temperament with the scientific spirit.&nbsp; The latter he
bequeathed to his disciples; the former was entirely his
own.&nbsp; The distinction between such a book as M. Zola&rsquo;s
<i>L&rsquo;Assommoir</i> and such a book as Balzac&rsquo;s
<i>Illusions Perdues</i> is the distinction between unimaginative
realism and imaginative reality.&nbsp; &lsquo;All Balzac&rsquo;s
characters,&rsquo; said Baudelaire, &lsquo;are gifted with the
same ardour of life that animated himself.&nbsp; All his fictions
are as deeply coloured as dreams.&nbsp; Every mind is a weapon
loaded to the muzzle with will.&nbsp; The very scullions have
genius.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was, of course, accused of being
immoral.&nbsp; Few writers who deal directly with life escape
that charge.&nbsp; His answer to the accusation was
characteristic and conclusive.&nbsp; &lsquo;Whoever contributes
his stone to the edifice of ideas,&rsquo; he wrote,
&lsquo;whoever proclaims an abuse, whoever sets his mark upon an
evil to be abolished, always passes for immoral.&nbsp; If you are
true in your portraits, if, by <!-- page 36--><a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>dint of daily
and nightly toil, you succeed in writing the most difficult
language in the world, the word immoral is thrown in your
face.&rsquo;&nbsp; The morals of the personages of the
<i>Com&eacute;die Humaine</i> are simply the morals of the world
around us.&nbsp; They are part of the artist&rsquo;s
subject-matter; they are not part of his method.&nbsp; If there
be any need of censure it is to life, not to literature, that it
should be given.&nbsp; Balzac, besides, is essentially
universal.&nbsp; He sees life from every point of view.&nbsp; He
has no preferences and no prejudices.&nbsp; He does not try to
prove anything.&nbsp; He feels that the spectacle of life
contains its own secret.&nbsp; &lsquo;Il cr&eacute;e un monde et
se tait.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And what a world it is!&nbsp; What a panorama of
passions!&nbsp; What a pell-mell of men and women!&nbsp; It was
said of Trollope that he increased the number of our
acquaintances without adding to our visiting list; but after the
<i>Com&eacute;die Humaine</i> one begins to believe that the only
real people are the people who never existed.&nbsp; Lucien de
Rubempr&eacute;, le P&egrave;re Goriot, Ursule Mirou&euml;t,
Marguerite Cla&euml;s, the Baron Hulot, Madame Marneffe, le
Cousin Pons, De Marsay&mdash;all bring with them a kind of
contagious illusion of life.&nbsp; They have a fierce vitality
about them: their existence is fervent and fiery-coloured; we not
merely feel for them but we see them&mdash;they dominate our
fancy and defy scepticism.&nbsp; A steady course of Balzac
reduces our living friends to shadows, and our acquaintances to
the shadows of shades.&nbsp; Who would care to go out to an
evening party to meet Tomkins, the friend of one&rsquo;s boyhood,
when one can sit at home with Lucien de Rubempr&eacute;?&nbsp; It
is pleasanter to have the entr&eacute;e to Balzac&rsquo;s society
than to receive cards from all the duchesses in Mayfair.</p>
<p><!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>In spite of this, there are many people who have
declared the <i>Com&eacute;die Humaine</i> to be
indigestible.&nbsp; Perhaps it is: but then what about
truffles?&nbsp; Balzac&rsquo;s publisher refused to be disturbed
by any such criticism as that.&nbsp; &lsquo;Indigestible, is
it?&rsquo; he exclaimed with what, for a publisher, was rare good
sense.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, I should hope so; who ever thinks of a
dinner that isn&rsquo;t?&rsquo;</p>

<h2>BEN JONSON<br />
(<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, September 20, 1886.)</h2>
<p>As for Mr. Symonds&rsquo; estimate of Jonson&rsquo;s genius,
it is in many points quite excellent.&nbsp; He ranks him with the
giants rather than with the gods, with those who compel our
admiration by their untiring energy and huge strength of
intellectual muscle, not with those &lsquo;who share the divine
gifts of creative imagination and inevitable
instinct.&rsquo;&nbsp; Here he is right.&nbsp; Pelion more than
Parnassus was Jonson&rsquo;s home.&nbsp; His art has too much
effort about it, too much definite intention.&nbsp; His style
lacks the charm of chance.&nbsp; Mr. Symonds is right also in the
stress he lays on the extraordinary combination in Jonson&rsquo;s
work of the most concentrated realism with encyclop&aelig;dic
erudition.&nbsp; In Jonson&rsquo;s comedies London slang and
learned scholarship go hand in hand.&nbsp; Literature was as
living a thing to him as life itself.&nbsp; He used his classical
lore not merely to give form to his verse, but to give flesh and
blood to the persons of his plays.&nbsp; He could build up a
breathing creature out of quotations.&nbsp; He made the <!-- page
38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>poets
of Greece and Rome terribly modern, and introduced them to the
oddest company.&nbsp; His very culture is an element in his
coarseness.&nbsp; There are moments when one is tempted to liken
him to a beast that has fed off books.</p>
<p>We cannot, however, agree with Mr. Symonds when he says that
Jonson &lsquo;rarely touched more than the outside of
character,&rsquo; that his men and women are &lsquo;the
incarnations of abstract properties rather than living human
beings,&rsquo; that they are in fact mere &lsquo;masqueraders and
mechanical puppets.&rsquo;&nbsp; Eloquence is a beautiful thing
but rhetoric ruins many a critic, and Mr. Symonds is essentially
rhetorical.&nbsp; When, for instance, he tells us that
&lsquo;Jonson made masks,&rsquo; while &lsquo;Dekker and Heywood
created souls,&rsquo; we feel that he is asking us to accept a
crude judgment for the sake of a smart antithesis.&nbsp; It is,
of course, true that we do not find in Jonson the same growth of
character that we find in Shakespeare, and we may admit that most
of the characters in Jonson&rsquo;s plays are, so to speak,
ready-made.&nbsp; But a ready-made character is not necessarily
either mechanical or wooden, two epithets Mr. Symonds uses
constantly in his criticism.</p>
<p>We cannot tell, and Shakespeare himself does not tell us, why
Iago is evil, why Regan and Goneril have hard hearts, or why Sir
Andrew Aguecheek is a fool.&nbsp; It is sufficient that they are
what they are, and that nature gives warrant for their
existence.&nbsp; If a character in a play is lifelike, if we
recognize it as true to nature, we have no right to insist on the
author explaining its genesis to us.&nbsp; We must accept it as
it is: and in the hands of a good dramatist mere presentation can
take the place of analysis, and indeed is often a more dramatic
method, because a more direct one.&nbsp; And <!-- page 39--><a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>Jonson&rsquo;s characters are true to nature.&nbsp; They
are in no sense abstractions; they are types.&nbsp; Captain
Bobadil and Captain Tucca, Sir John Daw and Sir Amorous La Foole,
Volpone and Mosca, Subtle and Sir Epicure Mammon, Mrs. Purecraft
and the Rabbi Busy are all creatures of flesh and blood, none the
less lifelike because they are labelled.&nbsp; In this point Mr.
Symonds seems to us unjust towards Jonson.</p>
<p>We think, also, that a special chapter might have been devoted
to Jonson as a literary critic.&nbsp; The creative activity of
the English Renaissance is so great that its achievements in the
sphere of criticism are often overlooked by the student.&nbsp;
Then, for the first time, was language treated as an art.&nbsp;
The laws of expression and composition were investigated and
formularized.&nbsp; The importance of words was recognized.&nbsp;
Romanticism, Realism and Classicism fought their first
battles.&nbsp; The dramatists are full of literary and art
criticisms, and amused the public with slashing articles on one
another in the form of plays.</p>

<h2>MR. SYMONDS&rsquo; HISTORY OF THE RENAISSANCE<br />
(<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, November 10, 1886.)</h2>
<p>Mr. Symonds has at last finished his history of the Italian
Renaissance.&nbsp; The two volumes just published deal with the
intellectual and moral conditions in Italy during the seventy
years of the sixteenth century which <!-- page 40--><a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>followed the
coronation of Charles the Fifth at Bologna, an era to which Mr.
Symonds gives the name of the Catholic Reaction, and they contain
a most interesting and valuable account of the position of Spain
in the Italian peninsula, the conduct of the Tridentine Council,
the specific organization of the Holy Office and the Company of
Jesus, and the state of society upon which those forces were
brought to bear.&nbsp; In his previous volumes Mr. Symonds had
regarded the past rather as a picture to be painted than as a
problem to be solved.&nbsp; In these two last volumes, however,
he shows a clearer appreciation of the office of history.&nbsp;
The art of the picturesque chronicler is completed by something
like the science of the true historian, the critical spirit
begins to manifest itself, and life is not treated as a mere
spectacle, but the laws of its evolution and progress are
investigated also.&nbsp; We admit that the desire to represent
life at all costs under dramatic conditions still accompanies Mr.
Symonds, and that he hardly realizes that what seems romance to
us was harsh reality to those who were engaged in it.&nbsp; Like
most dramatists, also, he is more interested in the psychological
exceptions than in the general rule.&nbsp; He has something of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s sovereign contempt of the masses.&nbsp; The
people stir him very little, but he is fascinated by great
personalities.&nbsp; Yet it is only fair to remember that the age
itself was one of exaggerated individualism, and that literature
had not yet become a mouthpiece for the utterances of
humanity.&nbsp; Men appreciated the aristocracy of intellect, but
with the democracy of suffering they had no sympathy.&nbsp; The
cry from the brickfields had still to be heard.&nbsp; Mr.
Symonds&rsquo; style, too, has much improved.&nbsp; Here and
there, it is true, we come <!-- page 41--><a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>across traces
of the old manner, as in the apocalyptic vision of the seven
devils that entered Italy with the Spaniard, and the description
of the Inquisition as a Belial-Moloch, a &lsquo;hideous idol
whose face was blackened with soot from burning human
flesh.&rsquo;&nbsp; Such a sentence, also, as &lsquo;over the
Dead Sea of social putrefaction floated the sickening oil of
Jesuitical hypocrisy,&rsquo; reminds us that rhetoric has not yet
lost its charms for Mr. Symonds.&nbsp; Still, on the whole, the
style shows far more reserve, balance and sobriety, than can be
found in the earlier volumes where violent antithesis forms the
predominant characteristic, and accuracy is often sacrificed to
an adjective.</p>
<p>Amongst the most interesting chapters of the book are those on
the Inquisition, on Sarpi, the great champion of the severance of
Church from State, and on Giordano Bruno.&nbsp; Indeed, the story
of Bruno&rsquo;s life, from his visit to London and Oxford, his
sojourn in Paris and wanderings through Germany, down to his
betrayal at Venice and martyrdom at Rome, is most powerfully
told, and the estimate of the value of his philosophy and the
relation he holds to modern science, is at once just and
appreciative.&nbsp; The account also of Ignatius Loyola and the
rise of the Society of Jesus is extremely interesting, though we
cannot think that Mr. Symonds is very happy in his comparison of
the Jesuits to &lsquo;fanatics laying stones upon a
railway&rsquo; or &lsquo;dynamiters blowing up an emperor or a
corner of Westminster Hall.&rsquo;&nbsp; Such a judgment is harsh
and crude in expression and more suitable to the clamour of the
Protestant Union than to the dignity of the true historian.&nbsp;
Mr. Symonds, however, is rarely deliberately unfair, and there is
no doubt but that his work on the Catholic Reaction <!-- page
42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>is a
most valuable contribution to modern history&mdash;so valuable,
indeed, that in the account he gives of the Inquisition in Venice
it would be well worth his while to bring the picturesque fiction
of the text into some harmony with the plain facts of the
footnote.</p>
<p>On the poetry of the sixteenth century Mr. Symonds has, of
course, a great deal to say, and on such subjects he always
writes with ease, grace, and delicacy of perception.&nbsp; We
admit that we weary sometimes of the continual application to
literature of epithets appropriate to plastic and pictorial
art.&nbsp; The conception of the unity of the arts is certainly
of great value, but in the present condition of criticism it
seems to us that it would be more useful to emphasize the fact
that each art has its separate method of expression.&nbsp; The
essay on Tasso, however, is delightful reading, and the position
the poet holds towards modern music and modern sentiment is
analysed with much subtlety.&nbsp; The essay on Marino also is
full of interest.&nbsp; We have often wondered whether those who
talk so glibly of Euphuism and Marinism in literature have ever
read either <i>Euphues</i> or the <i>Adone</i>.&nbsp; To the
latter they can have no better guide than Mr. Symonds, whose
description of the poem is most fascinating.&nbsp; Marino, like
many greater men, has suffered much from his disciples, but he
himself was a master of graceful fancy and of exquisite felicity
of phrase; not, of course, a great poet but certainly an artist
in poetry and one to whom language is indebted.&nbsp; Even those
conceits that Mr. Symonds feels bound to censure have something
charming about them.&nbsp; The continual use of periphrases is
undoubtedly a grave fault in style, yet who but a pedant would
really quarrel with such periphrases <!-- page 43--><a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>as <i>sirena
de&rsquo; boschi</i> for the nightingale, or <i>il novello
Edimione</i> for Galileo?</p>
<p>From the poets Mr. Symonds passes to the painters: not those
great artists of Florence and Venice of whom he has already
written, but the Eclectics of Bologna, the Naturalists of Naples
and Rome.&nbsp; This chapter is too polemical to be
pleasant.&nbsp; The one on music is much better, and Mr. Symonds
gives us a most interesting description of the gradual steps by
which the Italian genius passed from poetry and painting to
melody and song, till the whole of Europe thrilled with the
marvel and mystery of this new language of the soul.&nbsp; Some
small details should perhaps be noticed.&nbsp; It is hardly
accurate, for instance, to say that Monteverde&rsquo;s
<i>Orfeo</i> was the first form of the recitative-Opera, as
Peri&rsquo;s <i>Dafne</i> and <i>Euridice</i> and
Cavaliere&rsquo;s <i>Rappresentazione</i> preceded it by some
years, and it is somewhat exaggerated to say that &lsquo;under
the regime of the Commonwealth the national growth of English
music received a check from which it never afterwards
recovered,&rsquo; as it was with Cromwell&rsquo;s auspices that
the first English Opera was produced, thirteen years before any
Opera was regularly established in Paris.&nbsp; The fact that
England did not make such development in music as Italy and
Germany did, must be ascribed to other causes than &lsquo;the
prevalence of Puritan opinion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>These, however, are minor points.&nbsp; Mr. Symonds is to be
warmly congratulated on the completion of his history of the
Renaissance in Italy.&nbsp; It is a most wonderful monument of
literary labour, and its value to the student of Humanism cannot
be doubted.&nbsp; We have often had occasion to differ from Mr.
Symonds on questions of detail, and we have more <!-- page
44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>than
once felt it our duty to protest against the rhetoric and
over-emphasis of his style, but we fully recognize the importance
of his work and the impetus he has given to the study of one of
the vital periods of the world&rsquo;s history.&nbsp; Mr.
Symonds&rsquo; learning has not made him a pedant; his culture
has widened not narrowed his sympathies, and though he can hardly
be called a great historian, yet he will always occupy a place in
English literature as one of the remarkable men of letters in the
nineteenth century.</p>
<p class="gutcpm"><i>Renaissance in Italy</i>: <i>The Catholic
Reaction</i>.&nbsp; In Two Parts.&nbsp; By John Addington
Symonds.&nbsp; (Smith, Elder and Co.)</p>
<h2>MR. MORRIS&rsquo;S <i>ODYSSEY</i><br />
(<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, April 26, 1887.)</h2>
<p>Of all our modern poets, Mr. William Morris is the one best
qualified by nature and by art to translate for us the marvellous
epic of the wanderings of Odysseus.&nbsp; For he is our only true
story-singer since Chaucer; if he is a Socialist, he is also a
Saga-man; and there was a time when he was never wearied of
telling us strange legends of gods and men, wonderful tales of
chivalry and romance.&nbsp; Master as he is of decorative and
descriptive verse, he has all the Greek&rsquo;s joy in the
visible aspect of things, all the Greek&rsquo;s sense of delicate
and delightful detail, all the Greek&rsquo;s pleasure in
beautiful textures and exquisite materials and imaginative
designs; nor can any one have a keener sympathy with the Homeric
admiration for the workers and the craftsmen in the various arts,
from the stainers in white ivory and the embroiderers in purple
and <!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>gold, to the weaver sitting by the loom and the dyer
dipping in the vat, the chaser of shield and helmet, the carver
of wood or stone.&nbsp; And to all this is added the true temper
of high romance, the power to make the past as real to us as the
present, the subtle instinct to discern passion, the swift
impulse to portray life.</p>
<p>It is no wonder the lovers of Greek literature have so eagerly
looked forward to Mr. Morris&rsquo;s version of the Odyssean
epic, and now that the first volume has appeared, it is not
extravagant to say that of all our English translations this is
the most perfect and the most satisfying.&nbsp; In spite of
Coleridge&rsquo;s well-known views on the subject, we have always
held that Chapman&rsquo;s <i>Odyssey</i> is immeasurably inferior
to his <i>Iliad</i>, the mere difference of metre alone being
sufficient to set the former in a secondary place; Pope&rsquo;s
<i>Odyssey</i>, with its glittering rhetoric and smart
antithesis, has nothing of the grand manner of the original;
Cowper is dull, and Bryant dreadful, and Worsley too full of
Spenserian prettinesses; while excellent though Messrs. Butcher
and Lang&rsquo;s version undoubtedly is in many respects, still,
on the whole, it gives us merely the facts of the <i>Odyssey</i>
without providing anything of its artistic effect.&nbsp;
Avia&rsquo;s translation even, though better than almost all its
predecessors in the same field, is not worthy of taking rank
beside Mr. Morris&rsquo;s, for here we have a true work of art, a
rendering not merely of language into language, but of poetry
into poetry, and though the new spirit added in the transfusion
may seem to many rather Norse than Greek, and, perhaps at times,
more boisterous than beautiful, there is yet a vigour of life in
every line, a splendid ardour through each canto, that stirs the
blood while one reads like the sound of a trumpet, and that,
producing <!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>a physical as well as a spiritual
delight, exults the senses no less than it exalts the soul.&nbsp;
It may be admitted at once that, here and there, Mr. Morris has
missed something of the marvellous dignity of the Homeric verse,
and that, in his desire for rushing and ringing metre, he has
occasionally sacrificed majesty to movement, and made stateliness
give place to speed; but it is really only in such blank verse as
Milton&rsquo;s that this effect of calm and lofty music can be
attained, and in all other respects blank verse is the most
inadequate medium for reproducing the full flow and fervour of
the Greek hexameter.&nbsp; One merit, at any rate, Mr.
Morris&rsquo;s version entirely and absolutely possesses.&nbsp;
It is, in no sense of the word, literary; it seems to deal
immediately with life itself, and to take from the reality of
things its own form and colour; it is always direct and simple,
and at its best has something of the &lsquo;large utterance of
the early gods.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As for individual passages of beauty, nothing could be better
than the wonderful description of the house of the Ph&oelig;acian
king, or the whole telling of the lovely legend of Circe, or the
manner in which the pageant of the pale phantoms in Hades is
brought before our eyes.&nbsp; Perhaps the huge epic humour of
the escape from the Cyclops is hardly realized, but there is
always a linguistic difficulty about rendering this fascinating
story into English, and where we are given so much poetry we
should not complain about losing a pun; and the exquisite idyll
of the meeting and parting with the daughter of Alcinous is
really delightfully told.&nbsp; How good, for instance, is this
passage taken at random from the Sixth Book:</p>
<blockquote><p>But therewith unto the handmaids goodly Odysseus
spake:<br />
&lsquo;Stand off I bid you, damsels, while the work in hand I
take,<br />
<!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>And wash the brine from my shoulders, and sleek them all
around.<br />
Since verily now this long while sweet oil they have not
found.<br />
But before you nought will I wash me, for shame I have indeed,<br
/>
Amidst of fair-tressed damsels to be all bare of weed.&rsquo;<br
/>
So he spake and aloof they gat them, and thereof they told the
may,<br />
But Odysseus with the river from his body washed away<br />
The brine from his back and shoulders wrought broad and
mightily,<br />
And from his head was he wiping the foam of the untilled sea;<br
/>
But when he had thoroughly washed him, and the oil about him had
shed,<br />
He did upon the raiment the gift of the maid unwed.<br />
But Athene, Zeus-begotten, dealt with him in such wise<br />
That bigger yet was his seeming, and mightier to all eyes,<br />
With the hair on his head crisp curling as the bloom of the
daffodil.<br />
And as when the silver with gold is o&rsquo;erlaid by a man of
skill,<br />
Yea, a craftsman whom Heph&aelig;stus and Pallas Athene have
taught<br />
To be master over masters, and lovely work he hath wrought;<br />
So she round his head and his shoulders shed grace
abundantly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may be objected by some that the line</p>
<blockquote><p>With the hair on his head crisp curling as the
bloom of the daffodil,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is a rather fanciful version of</p>
<blockquote><p>&omicron;&upsilon;&lambda;&alpha;&sigmaf;
&eta;&kappa;&epsilon; &kappa;&omicron;&mu;&alpha;&sigmaf;,
&#973;&alpha;&kappa;&iota;&nu;&theta;&#943;&nu;&omega;
&alpha;&nu;&theta;&epsilon;&iota;
&omicron;&mu;&omicron;&iota;&alpha;&sigma;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and it certainly seems probable that the allusion is to the
dark colour of the hero&rsquo;s hair; still, the point is not one
of much importance, though it may be worth noting that a similar
expression occurs in Ogilby&rsquo;s superbly illustrated
translation of the <i>Odyssey</i>, published in 1665, where
Charles <span class="smcap">ii.</span>&rsquo;s Master of the
Revels in Ireland gives the passage thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>Minerva renders him more tall and fair,<br />
Curling in rings like daffodils his hair.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No anthology, however, can show the true merit of Mr.
Morris&rsquo;s translation, whose real merit does <!-- page
48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>not
depend on stray beauties, nor is revealed by chance selections,
but lies in the absolute rightness and coherence of the whole, in
its purity and justice of touch, its freedom from affectation and
commonplace, its harmony of form and matter.&nbsp; It is
sufficient to say that this is a poet&rsquo;s version of a poet,
and for such surely we should be thankful.&nbsp; In these latter
days of coarse and vulgar literature, it is something to have
made the great sea-epic of the South native and natural to our
northern isle, something to have shown that our English speech
may be a pipe through which Greek lips can blow, something to
have taught Nausicaa to speak the same language as Perdita.</p>

<h2>RUSSIAN NOVELISTS<br />
(<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, May 2, 1887.)</h2>
<p>Of the three great Russian novelists of our time Tourgenieff
is by far the finest artist.&nbsp; He has that spirit of
exquisite selection, that delicate choice of detail, which is the
essence of style; his work is entirely free from any personal
intention; and by taking existence at its most fiery-coloured
moments he can distil into a few pages of perfect prose the moods
and passions of many lives.</p>
<p>Count Tolstoi&rsquo;s method is much larger, and his field of
vision more extended.&nbsp; He reminds us sometimes of Paul
Veronese, and, like that great painter, can crowd, without
over-crowding, the giant canvas <!-- page 49--><a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>on which he
works.&nbsp; We may not at first gain from his works that
artistic unity of impression which is Tourgenieff&rsquo;s chief
charm, but once that we have mastered the details the whole seems
to have the grandeur and the simplicity of an epic.&nbsp;
Dostoieffski differs widely from both his rivals.&nbsp; He is not
so fine an artist as Tourgenieff, for he deals more with the
facts than with the effects of life; nor has he Tolstoi&rsquo;s
largeness of vision and epic dignity; but he has qualities that
are distinctively and absolutely his own, such as a fierce
intensity of passion and concentration of impulse, a power of
dealing with the deepest mysteries of psychology and the most
hidden springs of life, and a realism that is pitiless in its
fidelity, and terrible because it is true.&nbsp; Some time ago we
had occasion to draw attention to his marvellous novel <i>Crime
and Punishment</i>, where in the haunt of impurity and vice a
harlot and an assassin meet together to read the story of Dives
and Lazarus, and the outcast girl leads the sinner to make
atonement for his sin; nor is the book entitled <i>Injury and
Insult</i> at all inferior to that great masterpiece.&nbsp; Mean
and ordinary though the surroundings of the story may seem, the
heroine Natasha is like one of the noble victims of Greek
tragedy; she is Antigone with the passion of Ph&aelig;dra, and it
is impossible to approach her without a feeling of awe.&nbsp;
Greek also is the gloom of Nemesis that hangs over each
character, only it is a Nemesis that does not stand outside of
life, but is part of our own nature and of the same material as
life itself.&nbsp; Ale&oacute;sha, the beautiful young lad whom
Natasha follows to her doom, is a second Tito Melema, and has all
Tito&rsquo;s charm and grace and fascination.&nbsp; Yet he is
different.&nbsp; He would never have denied Baldassare in the
Square at Florence, nor lied to Romola about Tessa.&nbsp; He <!--
page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>has a magnificent, momentary sincerity, a boyish
unconsciousness of all that life signifies, an ardent enthusiasm
for all that life cannot give.&nbsp; There is nothing calculating
about him.&nbsp; He never thinks evil, he only does it.&nbsp;
From a psychological point of view he is one of the most
interesting characters of modern fiction, as from an artistic he
is one of the most attractive.&nbsp; As we grow to know him he
stirs strange questions for us, and makes us feel that it is not
the wicked only who do wrong, nor the bad alone who work
evil.</p>
<p>And by what a subtle objective method does Dostoieffski show
us his characters!&nbsp; He never tickets them with a list nor
labels them with a description.&nbsp; We grow to know them very
gradually, as we know people whom we meet in society, at first by
little tricks of manner, personal appearance, fancies in dress,
and the like; and afterwards by their deeds and words; and even
then they constantly elude us, for though Dostoieffski may lay
bare for us the secrets of their nature, yet he never explains
his personages away; they are always surprising us by something
that they say or do, and keep to the end the eternal mystery of
life.</p>
<p>Irrespective of its value as a work of art, this novel
possesses a deep autobiographical interest also, as the character
of Vania, the poor student who loves Natasha through all her sin
and shame, is Dostoieffski&rsquo;s study of himself.&nbsp; Goethe
once had to delay the completion of one of his novels till
experience had furnished him with new situations, but almost
before he had arrived at manhood Dostoieffski knew life in its
most real forms; poverty and suffering, pain and misery, prison,
exile, and love, were soon familiar to him, and by the lips of
Vania he has told his own story.&nbsp; This note of personal <!--
page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>feeling, this harsh reality of actual experience,
undoubtedly gives the book something of its strange fervour and
terrible passion, yet it has not made it egotistic; we see things
from every point of view, and we feel, not that fiction has been
trammelled by fact, but that fact itself has become ideal and
imaginative.&nbsp; Pitiless, too, though Dostoieffski is in his
method as an artist, as a man he is full of human pity for all,
for those who do evil as well as for those who suffer it, for the
selfish no less than for those whose lives are wrecked for others
and whose sacrifice is in vain.&nbsp; Since <i>Adam Bede</i> and
<i>Le P&egrave;re Goriot</i> no more powerful novel has been
written than <i>Insult and Injury</i>.</p>

<h2>MR. PATER&rsquo;S <i>IMAGINARY PORTRAITS</i><br />
(<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, June 11, 1887.)</h2>
<p>To convey ideas through the medium of images has always been
the aim of those who are artists as well as thinkers in
literature, and it is to a desire to give a sensuous environment
to intellectual concepts that we owe Mr. Pater&rsquo;s last
volume.&nbsp; For these Imaginary or, as we should prefer to call
them, Imaginative Portraits of his, form a series of philosophic
studies in which the philosophy is tempered by personality, and
the thought shown under varying conditions of mood and manner,
the very permanence of each principle gaining something through
the change and colour of the life through which it finds
expression.&nbsp; The most fascinating of all these pictures is
undoubtedly <!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>that of Sebastian Van Storck.&nbsp;
The account of Watteau is perhaps a little too fanciful, and the
description of him as one who was &lsquo;always a seeker after
something in the world, that is there in no satisfying measure,
or not at all,&rsquo; seems to us more applicable to him who saw
Mona Lisa sitting among the rocks than the gay and debonair
<i>peintre des f&ecirc;tes galantes</i>.&nbsp; But Sebastian, the
grave young Dutch philosopher, is charmingly drawn.&nbsp; From
the first glimpse we get of him, skating over the water-meadows
with his plume of squirrel&rsquo;s tail and his fur muff, in all
the modest pleasantness of boyhood, down to his strange death in
the desolate house amid the sands of the Helder, we seem to see
him, to know him, almost to hear the low music of his
voice.&nbsp; He is a dreamer, as the common phrase goes, and yet
he is poetical in this sense, that his theorems shape life for
him, directly.&nbsp; Early in youth he is stirred by a fine
saying of Spinoza, and sets himself to realize the ideal of an
intellectual disinterestedness, separating himself more and more
from the transient world of sensation, accident and even
affection, till what is finite and relative becomes of no
interest to him, and he feels that as nature is but a thought of
his, so he himself is but a passing thought of God.&nbsp; This
conception, of the power of a mere metaphysical abstraction over
the mind of one so fortunately endowed for the reception of the
sensible world, is exceedingly delightful, and Mr. Pater has
never written a more subtle psychological study, the fact that
Sebastian dies in an attempt to save the life of a little child
giving to the whole story a touch of poignant pathos and sad
irony.</p>
<p><i>Denys l&rsquo;Auxerrois</i> is suggested by a figure found,
<!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>or said to be found, on some old tapestries in Auxerre,
the figure of a &lsquo;flaxen and flowery creature, sometimes
well-nigh naked among the vine-leaves, sometimes muffled in skins
against the cold, sometimes in the dress of a monk, but always
with a strong impress of real character and incident from the
veritable streets&rsquo; of the town itself.&nbsp; From this
strange design Mr. Pater has fashioned a curious medi&aelig;val
myth of the return of Dionysus among men, a myth steeped in
colour and passion and old romance, full of wonder and full of
worship, Denys himself being half animal and half god, making the
world mad with a new ecstasy of living, stirring the artists
simply by his visible presence, drawing the marvel of music from
reed and pipe, and slain at last in a stage-play by those who had
loved him.&nbsp; In its rich affluence of imagery this story is
like a picture by Mantegna, and indeed Mantegna might have
suggested the description of the pageant in which Denys rides
upon a gaily-painted chariot, in soft silken raiment and, for
head-dress, a strange elephant scalp with gilded tusks.</p>
<p>If <i>Denys l&rsquo;Auxerrois</i> symbolizes the passion of
the senses and <i>Sebastian Van Storck</i> the philosophic
passion, as they certainly seem to do, though no mere formula or
definition can adequately express the freedom and variety of the
life that they portray, the passion for the imaginative world of
art is the basis of the story of <i>Duke Carl of
Rosenmold</i>.&nbsp; Duke Carl is not unlike the late King of
Bavaria, in his love of France, his admiration for the <i>Grand
Monarque</i> and his fantastic desire to amaze and to bewilder,
but the resemblance is possibly only a chance one.&nbsp; In fact
Mr. Pater&rsquo;s young hero is the precursor of the
<i>Aufkl&auml;rung</i> of <!-- page 54--><a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>the last
century, the German precursor of Herder and Lessing and Goethe
himself, and finds the forms of art ready to his hand without any
national spirit to fill them or make them vital and
responsive.&nbsp; He too dies, trampled to death by the soldiers
of the country he so much admired, on the night of his marriage
with a peasant girl, the very failure of his life lending him a
certain melancholy grace and dramatic interest.</p>
<p>On the whole, then, this is a singularly attractive
book.&nbsp; Mr. Pater is an intellectual impressionist.&nbsp; He
does not weary us with any definite doctrine or seek to suit life
to any formal creed.&nbsp; He is always looking for exquisite
moments and, when he has found them, he analyses them with
delicate and delightful art and then passes on, often to the
opposite pole of thought or feeling, knowing that every mood has
its own quality and charm and is justified by its mere
existence.&nbsp; He has taken the sensationalism of Greek
philosophy and made it a new method of art criticism.&nbsp; As
for his style, it is curiously ascetic.&nbsp; Now and then, we
come across phrases with a strange sensuousness of expression, as
when he tells us how Denys l&rsquo;Auxerrois, on his return from
a long journey, &lsquo;ate flesh for the first time, tearing the
hot, red morsels with his delicate fingers in a kind of wild
greed,&rsquo; but such passages are rare.&nbsp; Asceticism is the
keynote of Mr. Pater&rsquo;s prose; at times it is almost too
severe in its self-control and makes us long for a little more
freedom.&nbsp; For indeed, the danger of such prose as his is
that it is apt to become somewhat laborious.&nbsp; Here and
there, one is tempted to say of Mr. Pater that he is &lsquo;a
seeker after something in language, that is there in no
satisfying measure, or not at all.&rsquo;&nbsp; The continual
preoccupation with phrase and epithet has <!-- page 55--><a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>its drawbacks
as well as its virtues.&nbsp; And yet, when all is said, what
wonderful prose it is, with its subtle preferences, its
fastidious purity, its rejection of what is common or
ordinary!&nbsp; Mr. Pater has the true spirit of selection, the
true art of omission.&nbsp; If he be not among the greatest prose
writers of our literature he is, at least, our greatest artist in
prose; and though it may be admitted that the best style is that
which seems an unconscious result rather than a conscious aim,
still in these latter days when violent rhetoric does duty for
eloquence and vulgarity usurps the name of nature, we should be
grateful for a style that deliberately aims at perfection of
form, that seeks to produce its effect by artistic means and sets
before itself an ideal of grave and chastened beauty.</p>

<h2>A GERMAN PRINCESS<br />
(<i>Woman&rsquo;s World</i>, November 1887.)</h2>
<p>The Princess Christian&rsquo;s translation of the <i>Memoirs
of Wilhelmine</i>, <i>Margravine of Baireuth</i>, is a most
fascinating and delightful book.&nbsp; The Margravine and her
brother, Frederick the Great, were, as the Princess herself
points out in an admirably written introduction, &lsquo;among the
first of those questioning minds that strove after spiritual
freedom&rsquo; in the last century.&nbsp; &lsquo;They had
studied,&rsquo; says the Princess, &lsquo;the English
philosophers, Newton, Locke, and Shaftesbury, and were roused to
enthusiasm by the writings of Voltaire and Rousseau.&nbsp; Their
whole lives bore the impress of the influence of French <!-- page
56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>thought on the burning questions of the day.&nbsp; In
the eighteenth century began that great struggle of philosophy
against tyranny and worn-out abuses which culminated in the
French Revolution.&nbsp; The noblest minds were engaged in the
struggle, and, like most reformers, they pushed their conclusions
to extremes, and too often lost sight of the need of a due
proportion in things.&nbsp; The Margravine&rsquo;s influence on
the intellectual development of her country is untold.&nbsp; She
formed at Baireuth a centre of culture and learning which had
before been undreamt of in Germany.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The historical value of these <i>Memoirs</i> is, of course,
well known.&nbsp; Carlyle speaks of them as being &lsquo;by far
the best authority&rsquo; on the early life of Frederick the
Great.&nbsp; But considered merely as the autobiography of a
clever and charming woman, they are no less interesting, and even
those who care nothing for eighteenth-century politics, and look
upon history itself as an unattractive form of fiction, cannot
fail to be fascinated by the Margravine&rsquo;s wit, vivacity and
humour, by her keen powers of observation, and by her brilliant
and assertive egotism.&nbsp; Not that her life was by any means a
happy one.&nbsp; Her father, to quote the Princess Christian,
&lsquo;ruled his family with the same harsh despotism with which
he ruled his country, taking pleasure in making his power felt by
all in the most galling manner,&rsquo; and the Margravine and her
brother &lsquo;had much to suffer, not only from his ungovernable
temper, but also from the real privations to which they were
subjected.&rsquo;&nbsp; Indeed, the picture the Margravine gives
of the King is quite extraordinary.&nbsp; &lsquo;He despised all
learning,&rsquo; she writes, &lsquo;and wished me to occupy
myself with nothing but needlework and household duties or
details.&nbsp; Had he found me writing or <!-- page 57--><a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>reading, he
would probably have whipped me.&rsquo;&nbsp; He &lsquo;considered
music a capital offence, and maintained that every one should
devote himself to one object: men to the military service, and
women to their household duties.&nbsp; Science and the arts he
counted among the &ldquo;seven deadly sins.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp;
Sometimes he took to religion, &lsquo;and then,&rsquo; says the
Margravine, &lsquo;we lived like trappists, to the great grief of
my brother and myself.&nbsp; Every afternoon the King preached a
sermon, to which we had to listen as attentively as if it
proceeded from an Apostle.&nbsp; My brother and I were often
seized with such an intense sense of the ridiculous that we burst
out laughing, upon which an apostolic curse was poured out on our
heads, which we had to accept with a show of humility and
penitence.&rsquo;&nbsp; Economy and soldiers were his only topics
of conversation; his chief social amusement was to make his
guests intoxicated; and as for his temper, the accounts the
Margravine gives of it would be almost incredible if they were
not amply corroborated from other sources.&nbsp; Suetonius has
written of the strange madness that comes on kings, but even in
his melodramatic chronicles there is hardly anything that rivals
what the Margravine has to tell us.&nbsp; Here is one of her
pictures of family life at a Royal Court in the last century, and
it is not by any means the worst scene she describes:</p>
<blockquote><p>On one occasion, when his temper was more than
usually bad, he told the Queen that he had received letters from
Anspach, in which the Margrave announced his arrival at Berlin
for the beginning of May.&nbsp; He was coming there for the
purpose of marrying my sister, and one of his ministers would
arrive previously with the betrothal ring.&nbsp; My father asked
my sister whether she were pleased at this prospect, and how she
would arrange her household.&nbsp; Now my sister had always made
a point of telling him whatever came into her head, even the
greatest home-truths, <!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>and he had never taken her
outspokenness amiss.&nbsp; On this occasion, therefore, relying
on former experience, she answered him as follows: &lsquo;When I
have a house of my own, I shall take care to have a
well-appointed dinner-table, better than yours is, and if I have
children of my own, I shall not plague them as you do yours, and
force them to eat things they thoroughly dislike!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is amiss with my dinner-table?&rsquo; the King
enquired, getting very red in the face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You ask what is the matter with it,&rsquo; my sister
replied; &lsquo;there is not enough on it for us to eat, and what
there is is cabbage and carrots, which we detest.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Her first answer had already angered my father, but now he gave
vent to his fury.&nbsp; But instead of punishing my sister he
poured it all on my mother, my brother, and myself.&nbsp; To
begin with he threw his plate at my brother&rsquo;s head, who
would have been struck had he not got out of the way; a second
one he threw at me, which I also happily escaped; then torrents
of abuse followed these first signs of hostility.&nbsp; He
reproached the Queen with having brought up her children so
badly.&nbsp; &lsquo;You will curse your mother,&rsquo; he said to
my brother, &lsquo;for having made you such a good-for-nothing
creature.&rsquo; . . . As my brother and I passed near him to
leave the room, he hit out at us with his crutch.&nbsp; Happily
we escaped the blow, for it would certainly have struck us down,
and we at last escaped without harm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet, as the Princess Christian remarks, &lsquo;despite the
almost cruel treatment Wilhelmine received from her father, it is
noticeable that throughout her memoirs she speaks of him with the
greatest affection.&nbsp; She makes constant reference to his
&ldquo;good heart&rdquo;&rsquo;; and says that his faults
&lsquo;were more those of temper than of nature.&rsquo;&nbsp; Nor
could all the misery and wretchedness of her home life dull the
brightness of her intellect.&nbsp; What would have made others
morbid, made her satirical.&nbsp; Instead of weeping over her own
personal tragedies, she laughs at the general comedy of
life.&nbsp; Here, for instance, is her <!-- page 59--><a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>description
of Peter the Great and his wife, who arrived at Berlin in
1718:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Czarina was small, broad, and brown-looking,
without the slightest dignity or appearance.&nbsp; You had only
to look at her to detect her low origin.&nbsp; She might have
passed for a German actress, she had decked herself out in such a
manner.&nbsp; Her dress had been bought second-hand, and was
trimmed with some dirty looking silver embroidery; the bodice was
trimmed with precious stones, arranged in such a manner as to
represent the double eagle.&nbsp; She wore a dozen orders; and
round the bottom of her dress hung quantities of relics and
pictures of saints, which rattled when she walked, and reminded
one of a smartly harnessed mule.&nbsp; The orders too made a
great noise, knocking against each other.</p>
<p>The Czar, on the other hand, was tall and well grown, with a
handsome face, but his expression was coarse, and impressed one
with fear.&nbsp; He wore a simple sailor&rsquo;s dress.&nbsp; His
wife, who spoke German very badly, called her court jester to her
aid, and spoke Russian with her.&nbsp; This poor creature was a
Princess Gallizin, who had been obliged to undertake this sorry
office to save her life, as she had been mixed up in a conspiracy
against the Czar, and had twice been flogged with the knout!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The following day [the Czar] visited all the sights of Berlin,
amongst others the very curious collection of coins and
antiques.&nbsp; Amongst these last named was a statue,
representing a heathen god.&nbsp; It was anything but attractive,
but was the most valuable in the collection.&nbsp; The Czar
admired it very much, and insisted on the Czarina kissing
it.&nbsp; On her refusing, he said to her in bad German that she
should lose her head if she did not at once obey him.&nbsp; Being
terrified at the Czar&rsquo;s anger she immediately complied with
his orders without the least hesitation.&nbsp; The Czar asked the
King to give him this and other statues, a request which he could
not refuse.&nbsp; The same thing happened about a cupboard,
inlaid with amber.&nbsp; It was the only one of its kind, and had
cost King Frederick I. an enormous sum, and the <!-- page 60--><a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>consternation
was general on its having to be sent to Petersburg.</p>
<p>This barbarous Court happily left after two days.&nbsp; The
Queen rushed at once to Monbijou, which she found in a state
resembling that of the fall of Jerusalem.&nbsp; I never saw such
a sight.&nbsp; Everything was destroyed, so that the Queen was
obliged to rebuild the whole house.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nor are the Margravine&rsquo;s descriptions of her reception
as a bride in the principality of Baireuth less amusing.&nbsp;
Hof was the first town she came to, and a deputation of nobles
was waiting there to welcome her.&nbsp; This is her account of
them:</p>
<blockquote><p>Their faces would have frightened little children,
and, to add to their beauty, they had arranged their hair to
resemble the wigs that were then in fashion.&nbsp; Their dresses
clearly denoted the antiquity of their families, as they were
composed of heirlooms, and were cut accordingly, so that most of
them did not fit.&nbsp; In spite of their costumes being the
&lsquo;Court Dresses,&rsquo; the gold and silver trimmings were
so black that you had a difficulty in making out of what they
were made.&nbsp; The manners of these nobles suited their faces
and their clothes.&nbsp; They might have passed for
peasants.&nbsp; I could scarcely restrain my laughter when I
first beheld these strange figures.&nbsp; I spoke to each in
turn, but none of them understood what I said, and their replies
sounded to me like Hebrew, because the dialect of the Empire is
quite different from that spoken in Brandenburg.</p>
<p>The clergy also presented themselves.&nbsp; These were totally
different creatures.&nbsp; Round their necks they wore great
ruffs, which resembled washing baskets.&nbsp; They spoke very
slowly, so that I might be able to understand them better.&nbsp;
They said the most foolish things, and it was only with much
difficulty that I was able to prevent myself from laughing.&nbsp;
At last I got rid of all these people, and we sat down to
dinner.&nbsp; I tried my best to converse with those at table,
but it was useless.&nbsp; At last I touched on agricultural
topics, and then they began to thaw.&nbsp; I was at once informed
of all their different farmsteads <!-- page 61--><a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>and herds of
cattle.&nbsp; An almost interesting discussion took place as to
whether the oxen in the upper part of the country were fatter
than those in the lowlands.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>I was told that as the next day was Sunday, I must spend it at
Hof, and listen to a sermon.&nbsp; Never before had I heard such
a sermon!&nbsp; The clergyman began by giving us an account of
all the marriages that had taken place from Adam&rsquo;s time to
that of Noah.&nbsp; We were spared no detail, so that the
gentlemen all laughed and the poor ladies blushed.&nbsp; The
dinner went off as on the previous day.&nbsp; In the afternoon
all the ladies came to pay me their respects.&nbsp; Gracious
heavens!&nbsp; What ladies, too!&nbsp; They were all as ugly as
the gentlemen, and their head-dresses were so curious that
swallows might have built their nests in them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for Baireuth itself, and its petty Court, the picture she
gives of it is exceedingly curious.&nbsp; Her father-in-law, the
reigning Margrave, was a narrow-minded mediocrity, whose
conversation &lsquo;resembled that of a sermon read aloud for the
purpose of sending the listener to sleep,&rsquo; and he had only
two topics, Telemachus, and Amelot de la Houssaye&rsquo;s
<i>Roman History</i>.&nbsp; The Ministers, from Baron von Stein,
who always said &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to everything, to Baron von
Voit, who always said &lsquo;no,&rsquo; were not by any means an
intellectual set of men.&nbsp; &lsquo;Their chief
amusement,&rsquo; says the Margravine, &lsquo;was drinking from
morning till night,&rsquo; and horses and cattle were all they
talked about.&nbsp; The palace itself was shabby, decayed and
dirty.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was like a lamb among wolves,&rsquo; cries
the poor Margravine; &lsquo;I was settled in a strange country,
at a Court which more resembled a peasant&rsquo;s farm,
surrounded by coarse, bad, dangerous, and tiresome
people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yet her <i>esprit</i> never deserted her.&nbsp; She is always
clever, witty, and entertaining.&nbsp; Her stories about <!--
page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>the endless squabbles over precedence are extremely
amusing.&nbsp; The society of her day cared very little for good
manners, knew, indeed, very little about them, but all questions
of etiquette were of vital importance, and the Margravine
herself, though she saw the shallowness of the whole system, was
far too proud not to assert her rights when circumstances
demanded it, as the description she gives of her visit to the
Empress of Germany shows very clearly.&nbsp; When this meeting
was first proposed, the Margravine declined positively to
entertain the idea.&nbsp; &lsquo;There was no precedent,&rsquo;
she writes, &lsquo;of a King&rsquo;s daughter and the Empress
having met, and I did not know to what rights I ought to lay
claim.&rsquo;&nbsp; Finally, however, she is induced to consent,
but she lays down three conditions for her reception:</p>
<blockquote><p>I desired first of all that the Empress&rsquo;s
Court should receive me at the foot of the stairs, secondly, that
she should meet me at the door of her bedroom, and, thirdly, that
she should offer me an armchair to sit on.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>They disputed all day over the conditions I had made.&nbsp;
The two first were granted me, but all that could be obtained
with respect to the third was, that the Empress would use quite a
small armchair, whilst she gave me a chair.</p>
<p>Next day I saw this Royal personage.&nbsp; I own that had I
been in her place I would have made all the rules of etiquette
and ceremony the excuse for not being obliged to appear.&nbsp;
The Empress was small and stout, round as a ball, very ugly, and
without dignity or manner.&nbsp; Her mind corresponded to her
body.&nbsp; She was terribly bigoted, and spent her whole day
praying.&nbsp; The old and ugly are generally the
Almighty&rsquo;s portion.&nbsp; She received me trembling all
over, and was so upset that she could not say a word.</p>
<p>After some silence I began the conversation in French.&nbsp;
She answered me in her Austrian dialect that she could not speak
in that language, and begged I would speak in <!-- page 63--><a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>German.&nbsp;
The conversation did not last long, for the Austrian and low
Saxon tongues are so different from each other that to those
acquainted with only one the other is unintelligible.&nbsp; This
is what happened to us.&nbsp; A third person would have laughed
at our misunderstandings, for we caught only a word here and
there, and had to guess the rest.&nbsp; The poor Empress was such
a slave to etiquette that she would have thought it high treason
had she spoken to me in a foreign language, though she understood
French quite well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many other extracts might be given from this delightful book,
but from the few that have been selected some idea can be formed
of the vivacity and picturesqueness of the Margravine&rsquo;s
style.&nbsp; As for her character, it is very well summed up by
the Princess Christian, who, while admitting that she often
appears almost heartless and inconsiderate, yet claims that,
&lsquo;taken as a whole, she stands out in marked prominence
among the most gifted women of the eighteenth century, not only
by her mental powers, but by her goodness of heart, her
self-sacrificing devotion, and true friendship.&rsquo;&nbsp; An
interesting sequel to her <i>Memoirs</i> would be her
correspondence with Voltaire, and it is to be hoped that we may
shortly see a translation of these letters from the same
accomplished pen to which we owe the present volume. <a

Baireuth</i>.&nbsp; Translated and edited by Her Royal Highness

Britain and Ireland.&nbsp; (David Stott.)</p>
<h2>A VILLAGE TRAGEDY</h2>
<p>One of the most powerful and pathetic novels that has recently
appeared is <i>A Village Tragedy</i> by Margaret L. Woods.&nbsp;
To find any parallel to this <!-- page 64--><a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>lurid little
story, one must go to Dostoieffski or to Guy de Maupassant.&nbsp;
Not that Mrs. Woods can be said to have taken either of these two
great masters of fiction as her model, but there is something in
her work that recalls their method; she has not a little of their
fierce intensity, their terrible concentration, their passionless
yet poignant objectivity; like them, she seems to allow life to
suggest its own mode of presentation; and, like them, she
recognizes that a frank acceptance of the facts of life is the
true basis of all modern imitative art.&nbsp; The scene of Mrs.
Woods&rsquo;s story lies in one of the villages near Oxford; the
characters are very few in number, and the plot is extremely
simple.&nbsp; It is a romance of modern Arcadia&mdash;a tale of
the love of a farm-labourer for a girl who, though slightly above
him in social station and education, is yet herself also a
servant on a farm.&nbsp; True Arcadians they are, both of them,
and their ignorance and isolation serve only to intensify the
tragedy that gives the story its title.&nbsp; It is the fashion
nowadays to label literature, so, no doubt, Mrs. Woods&rsquo;s
novel will be spoken of as &lsquo;realistic.&rsquo;&nbsp; Its
realism, however, is the realism of the artist, not of the
reporter; its tact of treatment, subtlety of perception, and fine
distinction of style, make it rather a poem than a
<i>proc&egrave;s-verbal</i>; and though it lays bare to us the
mere misery of life, it suggests something of life&rsquo;s
mystery also.&nbsp; Very delicate, too, is the handling of
external Nature.&nbsp; There are no formal guide-book
descriptions of scenery, nor anything of what Byron petulantly
called &lsquo;twaddling about trees,&rsquo; but we seem to
breathe the atmosphere of the country, to catch the exquisite
scent of the beanfields, so familiar to all who have ever
wandered through the Oxfordshire lanes in June; to hear the birds
singing in the <!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>thicket, and the sheep-bells tinkling
from the hill.</p>
<p>Characterization, that enemy of literary form, is such an
essential part of the method of the modern writer of fiction,
that Nature has almost become to the novelist what light and
shade are to the painter&mdash;the one permanent element of
style; and if the power of <i>A Village Tragedy</i> be due to its
portrayal of human life, no small portion of its charm comes from
its Theocritean setting.</p>

<h2>MR. MORRIS&rsquo;S COMPLETION OF THE <i>ODYSSEY</i><br />
(<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, November 24, 1887.)</h2>
<p>Mr. Morris&rsquo;s second volume brings the great romantic
epic of Greek literature to its perfect conclusion, and although
there can never be an ultimate translation of either <i>Iliad</i>
or <i>Odyssey</i>, as each successive age is sure to find
pleasure in rendering the two poems in its own manner and
according to its own canons of taste, still it is not too much to
say that Mr. Morris&rsquo;s version will always be a true classic
amongst our classical translations.&nbsp; It is not, of course,
flawless.&nbsp; In our notice of the first volume we ventured to
say that Mr. Morris was sometimes far more Norse than Greek, nor
does the volume that now lies before us make us alter that
opinion.&nbsp; The particular metre, also, selected by Mr.
Morris, although admirably adapted to express &lsquo;the
strong-winged music of Homer,&rsquo; as far as its flow and
freedom are concerned, misses something of its dignity and
calm.&nbsp; Here, it must be admitted, we feel a distinct loss,
for there is in Homer not a little <!-- page 66--><a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>of
Milton&rsquo;s lofty manner, and if swiftness be an essential of
the Greek hexameter, stateliness is one of its distinguishing
qualities in Homer&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; This defect, however, if
we must call it a defect, seems almost unavoidable, as for
certain metrical reasons a majestic movement in English verse is
necessarily a slow movement; and, after all that can be said is
said, how really admirable is this whole translation!&nbsp; If we
set aside its noble qualities as a poem and look on it purely
from the scholar&rsquo;s point of view, how straightforward it
is, how honest and direct!&nbsp; Its fidelity to the original is
far beyond that of any other verse-translation in our literature,
and yet it is not the fidelity of a pedant to his text but rather
the fine loyalty of poet to poet.</p>
<p>When Mr. Morris&rsquo;s first volume appeared many of the
critics complained that his occasional use of archaic words and
unusual expressions robbed his version of the true Homeric
simplicity.&nbsp; This, however, is not a very felicitous
criticism, for while Homer is undoubtedly simple in his clearness
and largeness of vision, his wonderful power of direct narration,
his wholesome sanity, and the purity and precision of his method,
simple in language he undoubtedly is not.&nbsp; What he was to
his contemporaries we have, of course, no means of judging, but
we know that the Athenian of the fifth century <span
class="smcap">b.c.</span> found him in many places difficult to
understand, and when the creative age was succeeded by the age of
criticism and Alexandria began to take the place of Athens as the
centre of culture for the Hellenistic world, Homeric dictionaries
and glossaries seem to have been constantly published.&nbsp;
Indeed, Athen&aelig;us tells us of a wonderful Byzantine
blue-stocking, a <i>pr&eacute;cieuse</i> from the Propontis, who
wrote a long hexameter poem, called <i>Mnemosyne</i>, <!-- page
67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>full
of ingenious commentaries on difficulties in Homer, and in fact,
it is evident that, as far as the language is concerned, such a
phrase as &lsquo;Homeric simplicity&rsquo; would have rather
amazed an ancient Greek.&nbsp; As for Mr. Morris&rsquo;s tendency
to emphasize the etymological meaning of words, a point commented
on with somewhat flippant severity in a recent number of
<i>Macmillan</i>&rsquo;<i>s Magazine</i>, here Mr. Morris seems
to us to be in complete accord, not merely with the spirit of
Homer, but with the spirit of all early poetry.&nbsp; It is quite
true that language is apt to degenerate into a system of almost
algebraic symbols, and the modern city-man who takes a ticket for
Blackfriars Bridge, naturally never thinks of the Dominican monks
who once had their monastery by Thames-side, and after whom the
spot is named.&nbsp; But in earlier times it was not so.&nbsp;
Men were then keenly conscious of the real meaning of words, and
early poetry, especially, is full of this feeling, and, indeed,
may be said to owe to it no small portion of its poetic power and
charm.&nbsp; These old words, then, and this old use of words
which we find in Mr. Morris&rsquo;s <i>Odyssey</i> can be amply
justified upon historical grounds, and as for their artistic
effect, it is quite excellent.&nbsp; Pope tried to put Homer into
the ordinary language of his day, with what result we know only
too well; but Mr. Morris, who uses his archaisms with the tact of
a true artist, and to whom indeed they seem to come absolutely
naturally, has succeeded in giving to his version by their aid
that touch, not of &lsquo;quaintness,&rsquo; for Homer is never
quaint, but of old-world romance and old-world beauty, which we
moderns find so pleasurable, and to which the Greeks themselves
were so keenly sensitive.</p>
<p>As for individual passages of special merit, Mr.
Morris&rsquo;s translation is no robe of rags sewn with <!-- page
68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>purple patches for critics to sample.&nbsp; Its real
value lies in the absolute rightness and coherence of the whole,
in the grand architecture of the swift, strong verse, and in the
fact that the standard is not merely high but everywhere
sustained.&nbsp; It is impossible, however, to resist the
temptation of quoting Mr. Morris&rsquo;s rendering of that famous
passage in the twenty-third book of the epic, in which Odysseus
eludes the trap laid for him by Penelope, whose very faith in the
certainty of her husband&rsquo;s return makes her sceptical of
his identity when he stands before her; an instance, by the way,
of Homer&rsquo;s wonderful psychological knowledge of human
nature, as it is always the dreamer himself who is most surprised
when his dream comes true.</p>
<blockquote><p>Thus she spake to prove her husband; but Odysseus,
grieved at heart,<br />
Spake thus unto his bed-mate well-skilled in gainful art:<br />
&lsquo;O woman, thou sayest a word exceeding grievous to me!<br
/>
Who hath otherwhere shifted my bedstead? full hard for him should
it be,<br />
For as deft as he were, unless soothly a very God come here,<br
/>
Who easily, if he willed it, might shift it otherwhere.<br />
But no mortal man is living, how strong soe&rsquo;er in his
youth,<br />
Who shall lightly hale it elsewhere, since a mighty wonder
forsooth<br />
Is wrought in that fashioned bedstead, and I wrought it, and I
alone.<br />
In the close grew a thicket of olive, a long-leaved tree
full-grown,<br />
That flourished and grew goodly as big as a pillar about,<br />
So round it I built my bride-room, till I did the work right
out<br />
With ashlar stone close-fitting; and I roofed it overhead,<br />
And thereto joined doors I made me, well-fitting in their
stead.<br />
Then I lopped away the boughs of the long-leafed olive-tree,<br
/>
And, shearing the bole from the root up full well and
cunningly,<br />
I planed it about with the brass, and set the rule thereto,<br />
And shaping thereof a bed-post, with the wimble I bored it
through.<br />
So beginning, I wrought out the bedstead, and finished it
utterly,<br />
And with gold enwrought it about, and with silver and ivory,<br
/>
And stretched on it a thong of oxhide with the purple dye made
bright.<br />
Thus then the sign I have shown thee; nor, woman, know I
aright<br />
If my bed yet bideth steadfast, or if to another place<br />
Some man hath moved it, and smitten the olive-bole from its
base.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>These last twelve books of the <i>Odyssey</i> have not
the same marvel of romance, adventure and colour that we find in
the earlier part of the epic.&nbsp; There is nothing in them that
we can compare to the exquisite idyll of Nausicaa or to the
Titanic humour of the episode in the Cyclops&rsquo; cave.&nbsp;
Penelope has not the glamour of Circe, and the song of the Sirens
may sound sweeter than the whizz of the arrows of Odysseus as he
stands on the threshold of his hall.&nbsp; Yet, for sheer
intensity of passionate power, for concentration of intellectual
interest and for masterly dramatic construction, these latter
books are quite unequalled.&nbsp; Indeed, they show very clearly
how it was that, as Greek art developed, the epos passed into the
drama.&nbsp; The whole scheme of the argument, the return of the
hero in disguise, his disclosure of himself to his son, his
terrible vengeance on his enemies and his final recognition by
his wife, reminds us of the plot of more than one Greek play, and
shows us what the great Athenian poet meant when he said that his
own dramas were merely scraps from Homer&rsquo;s table.&nbsp; In
rendering this splendid poem into English verse, Mr. Morris has
done our literature a service that can hardly be over-estimated,
and it is pleasant to think that, even should the classics be
entirely excluded from our educational systems, the English boy
will still be able to know something of Homer&rsquo;s delightful
tales, to catch an echo of his grand music and to wander with the
wise Odysseus round &lsquo;the shores of old romance.&rsquo;</p>

(<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, November 30, 1887.)</h2>
<p>Phyllis Browne&rsquo;s Life of Mrs. Somerville forms part of a
very interesting little series, called &lsquo;The World&rsquo;s
Workers&rsquo;&mdash;a collection of short biographies catholic
enough to include personalities so widely different as Turner and
Richard Cobden, Handel and Sir Titus Salt, Robert Stephenson and
Florence Nightingale, and yet possessing a certain definite
aim.&nbsp; As a mathematician and a scientist, the translator and
popularizer of <i>La M&eacute;canique C&eacute;leste</i>, and the
author of an important book on physical geography, Mrs.
Somerville is, of course, well known.&nbsp; The scientific bodies
of Europe covered her with honours; her bust stands in the hall
of the Royal Society, and one of the Women&rsquo;s Colleges at
Oxford bears her name.&nbsp; Yet, considered simply in the light
of a wife and a mother, she is no less admirable; and those who
consider that stupidity is the proper basis for the domestic
virtues, and that intellectual women must of necessity be
helpless with their hands, cannot do better than read Phyllis
Browne&rsquo;s pleasant little book, in which they will find that
the greatest woman-mathematician of any age was a clever
needlewoman, a good housekeeper, and a most skilful cook.&nbsp;
Indeed, Mrs. Somerville seems to have been quite renowned for her
cookery.&nbsp; The discoverers of the North-West Passage
christened an island &lsquo;Somerville,&rsquo; not as a tribute
to the distinguished mathematician, but as a recognition of the
excellence of some orange marmalade which the distinguished
mathematician had prepared with <!-- page 71--><a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>her own hands
and presented to the ships before they left England; and to the
fact that she was able to make currant jelly at a very critical
moment she owed the affection of some of her husband&rsquo;s
relatives, who up to that time had been rather prejudiced against
her on the ground that she was merely an unpractical
Blue-stocking.</p>
<p>Nor did her scientific knowledge ever warp or dull the
tenderness and humanity of her nature.&nbsp; For birds and
animals she had always a great love.&nbsp; We hear of her as a
little girl watching with eager eyes the swallows as they built
their nests in summer or prepared for their flight in the autumn;
and when snow was on the ground she used to open the windows to
let the robins hop in and pick crumbs on the
breakfast-table.&nbsp; On one occasion she went with her father
on a tour in the Highlands, and found on her return that a pet
goldfinch, which had been left in the charge of the servants, had
been neglected by them and had died of starvation.&nbsp; She was
almost heart-broken at the event, and in writing her
<i>Recollections</i>, seventy years after, she mentioned it and
said that, as she wrote, she felt deep pain.&nbsp; Her chief pet
in her old age was a mountain sparrow, which used to perch on her
arm and go to sleep there while she was writing.&nbsp; One day
the sparrow fell into the water-jug and was drowned, to the great
grief of its mistress who could hardly be consoled for its loss,
though later on we hear of a beautiful paroquet taking the place
of <i>le moineau d&rsquo;Uranie</i>, and becoming Mrs.
Somerville&rsquo;s constant companion.&nbsp; She was also very
energetic, Phyllis Browne tells us, in trying to get a law passed
in the Italian Parliament for the protection of animals, and said
once, with reference to this subject, &lsquo;We English cannot
boast of <!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>humanity so long as our sportsmen
find pleasure in shooting down tame pigeons as they fly terrified
out of a cage&rsquo;&mdash;a remark with which I entirely
agree.&nbsp; Mr. Herbert&rsquo;s Bill for the protection of land
birds gave her immense pleasure, though, to quote her own words,
she was &lsquo;grieved to find that &ldquo;the lark, which at
heaven&rsquo;s gate sings,&rdquo; is thought unworthy of
man&rsquo;s protection&rsquo;; and she took a great fancy to a
gentleman who, on being told of the number of singing birds that
is eaten in Italy&mdash;nightingales, goldfinches, and
robins&mdash;exclaimed in horror, &lsquo;What! robins! our
household birds!&nbsp; I would as soon eat a child!&rsquo;&nbsp;
Indeed, she believed to some extent in the immortality of animals
on the ground that, if animals have no future, it would seem as
if some were created for uncompensated misery&mdash;an idea which
does not seem to me to be either extravagant or fantastic, though
it must be admitted that the optimism on which it is based
receives absolutely no support from science.</p>
<p>On the whole, Phyllis Browne&rsquo;s book is very pleasant
reading.&nbsp; Its only fault is that it is far too short, and
this is a fault so rare in modern literature that it almost
amounts to a distinction.&nbsp; However, Phyllis Browne has
managed to crowd into the narrow limits at her disposal a great
many interesting anecdotes.&nbsp; The picture she gives of Mrs.
Somerville working away at her translation of Laplace in the same
room with her children is very charming, and reminds one of what
is told of George Sand; there is an amusing account of Mrs.
Somerville&rsquo;s visit to the widow of the young Pretender, the
Countess of Albany, who, after talking with her for some time,
exclaimed, &lsquo;So you don&rsquo;t speak Italian.&nbsp; You
must have had a very bad education&rsquo;!&nbsp; <!-- page
73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>And
this story about the Waverley Novels may possibly be new to some
of my readers:</p>
<blockquote><p>A very amusing circumstance in connection with
Mrs. Somerville&rsquo;s acquaintance with Sir Walter arose out of
the childish inquisitiveness of Woronzow Greig, Mrs.
Somerville&rsquo;s little boy.</p>
<p>During the time Mrs. Somerville was visiting Abbotsford the
Waverley Novels were appearing, and were creating a great
sensation; yet even Scott&rsquo;s intimate friends did not know
that he was the author; he enjoyed keeping the affair a
mystery.&nbsp; But little Woronzow discovered what he was
about.&nbsp; One day when Mrs. Somerville was talking about a
novel that had just been published, Woronzow said, &lsquo;I knew
all these stories long ago, for Mr. Scott writes on the
dinner-table; when he has finished he puts the green cloth with
the papers in a corner of the dining-room, and when he goes out
Charlie Scott and I read the stories.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Phyllis Browne remarks that this incident shows &lsquo;that
persons who want to keep a secret ought to be very careful when
children are about&rsquo;; but the story seems to me to be far
too charming to require any moral of the kind.</p>
<p>Bound up in the same volume is a Life of Miss Mary Carpenter,
also written by Phyllis Browne.&nbsp; Miss Carpenter does not
seem to me to have the charm and fascination of Mrs.
Somerville.&nbsp; There is always something about her that is
formal, limited, and precise.&nbsp; When she was about two years
old she insisted on being called &lsquo;Doctor Carpenter&rsquo;
in the nursery; at the age of twelve she is described by a friend
as a sedate little girl, who always spoke like a book; and before
she entered on her educational schemes she wrote down a solemn
dedication of herself to the service of humanity.&nbsp; However,
she was one of the practical, hardworking saints of the
nineteenth century, and it is no doubt quite <!-- page 74--><a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>right that
the saints should take themselves very seriously.&nbsp; It is
only fair also to remember that her work of rescue and
reformation was carried on under great difficulties.&nbsp; Here,
for instance, is the picture Miss Cobbe gives us of one of the
Bristol night-schools:</p>
<blockquote><p>It was a wonderful spectacle to see Mary Carpenter
sitting patiently before the large school gallery in St.
James&rsquo;s Back, teaching, singing, and praying with the wild
street-boys, in spite of endless interruptions caused by such
proceedings as shooting marbles at any object behind her,
whistling, stamping, fighting, shrieking out &lsquo;Amen&rsquo;
in the middle of a prayer, and sometimes rising <i>en masse</i>
and tearing like a troop of bisons in hob-nailed shoes down from
the gallery, round the great schoolroom, and down the stairs, and
into the street.&nbsp; These irrepressible outbreaks she bore
with infinite good humour.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Her own account is somewhat pleasanter, and shows that
&lsquo;the troop of bisons in hob-nailed shoes&rsquo; was not
always so barbarous.</p>
<blockquote><p>I had taken to my class on the preceding week some
specimens of ferns neatly gummed on white paper. . . . This time
I took a piece of coal-shale, with impressions of ferns, to show
them. . . . I told each to examine the specimen, and tell me what
he thought it was.&nbsp; W. gave so bright a smile that I saw he
knew; none of the others could tell; he said they were ferns,
like what I showed them last week, but he thought they were
chiselled on the stone.&nbsp; Their surprise and pleasure were
great when I explained the matter to them.</p>
<p>The history of Joseph: they all found a difficulty in
realizing that this had actually occurred.&nbsp; One asked if
Egypt existed now, and if people lived in it.&nbsp; When I told
them that buildings now stood which had been erected about the
time of Joseph, one said that it was impossible, as they must
have fallen down ere this.&nbsp; I showed them the form of a
pyramid, and they were satisfied.&nbsp; One asked if <i>all</i>
books were true.</p>
<p><!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>The story of Macbeth impressed them very much.&nbsp;
They knew the name of Shakespeare, having seen his name over a
public-house.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A boy defined conscience as &lsquo;a thing a gentleman
hasn&rsquo;t got, who, when a boy finds his purse and gives it
back to him, doesn&rsquo;t give the boy sixpence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another boy was asked, after a Sunday evening lecture on
&lsquo;Thankfulness,&rsquo; what pleasure he enjoyed most in the
course of a year.&nbsp; He replied candidly,
&lsquo;Cock-fightin&rsquo;, ma&rsquo;am; there&rsquo;s a pit up
by the &ldquo;Black Boy&rdquo; as is worth anythink in
Brissel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There is something a little pathetic in the attempt to
civilize the rough street-boy by means of the refining influence
of ferns and fossils, and it is difficult to help feeling that
Miss Carpenter rather over-estimated the value of elementary
education.&nbsp; The poor are not to be fed upon facts.&nbsp;
Even Shakespeare and the Pyramids are not sufficient; nor is
there much use in giving them the results of culture, unless we
also give them those conditions under which culture can be
realized.&nbsp; In these cold, crowded cities of the North, the
proper basis for morals, using the word in its wide Hellenic
signification, is to be found in architecture, not in books.</p>
<p>Still, it would be ungenerous not to recognize that Mary
Carpenter gave to the children of the poor not merely her
learning, but her love.&nbsp; In early life, her biographer tells
us, she had longed for the happiness of being a wife and a
mother; but later she became content that her affection could be
freely given to all who needed it, and the verse in the
prophecies, &lsquo;I have given thee children whom thou hast not
borne,&rsquo; seemed to her to indicate what was to be her true
mission.&nbsp; Indeed, she rather inclined to Bacon&rsquo;s
opinion, that unmarried <!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>people do the best public work.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is quite striking,&rsquo; she says in one of her
letters, &lsquo;to observe how much the useful power and
influence of woman has developed of late years.&nbsp; Unattached
ladies, such as widows and unmarried women, have quite ample work
to do in the world for the good of others to absorb all their
powers.&nbsp; Wives and mothers have a very noble work given them
by God, and want no more.&rsquo;&nbsp; The whole passage is
extremely interesting, and the phrase &lsquo;unattached
ladies&rsquo; is quite delightful, and reminds one of Charles
Lamb.</p>

<h2>ARISTOTLE AT AFTERNOON TEA<br />
(<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, December 16, 1887.)</h2>
<p>In society, says Mr. Mahaffy, every civilized man and woman
ought to feel it their duty to say something, even when there is
hardly anything to be said, and, in order to encourage this
delightful art of brilliant chatter, he has published a social
guide without which no <i>d&eacute;butante</i> or dandy should
ever dream of going out to dine.&nbsp; Not that Mr.
Mahaffy&rsquo;s book can be said to be, in any sense of the word,
popular.&nbsp; In discussing this important subject of
conversation, he has not merely followed the scientific method of
Aristotle which is, perhaps, excusable, but he has adopted the
literary style of Aristotle for which no excuse is
possible.&nbsp; There is, also, hardly a single anecdote, hardly
a single illustration, and the reader is left to put the
Professor&rsquo;s abstract rules into practice, without <!-- page
77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>either the examples or the warnings of history to
encourage or to dissuade him in his reckless career.&nbsp; Still,
the book can be warmly recommended to all who propose to
substitute the vice of verbosity for the stupidity of
silence.&nbsp; It fascinates in spite of its form and pleases in
spite of its pedantry, and is the nearest approach, that we know
of, in modern literature to meeting Aristotle at an afternoon
tea.</p>
<p>As regards physical conditions, the only one that is
considered by Mr. Mahaffy as being absolutely essential to a good
conversationalist, is the possession of a musical voice.&nbsp;
Some learned writers have been of opinion that a slight stammer
often gives peculiar zest to conversation, but Mr. Mahaffy
rejects this view and is extremely severe on every eccentricity
from a native brogue to an artificial catchword.&nbsp; With his
remarks on the latter point, the meaningless repetition of
phrases, we entirely agree.&nbsp; Nothing can be more irritating
than the scientific person who is always saying &lsquo;<i>Exactly
so</i>,&rsquo; or the commonplace person who ends every sentence
with &lsquo;<i>Don&rsquo;t you know</i>?&rsquo; or the
pseudo-artistic person who murmurs &lsquo;<i>Charming</i>,
<i>charming</i>,&rsquo; on the smallest-provocation.&nbsp; It is,
however, with the mental and moral qualifications for
conversation that Mr. Mahaffy specially deals.&nbsp; Knowledge
he, naturally, regards as an absolute essential, for, as he most
justly observes, &lsquo;an ignorant man is seldom agreeable,
except as a butt.&rsquo;&nbsp; Upon the other hand, strict
accuracy should be avoided.&nbsp; &lsquo;Even a consummate
liar,&rsquo; says Mr. Mahaffy, is a better ingredient in a
company than &lsquo;the scrupulously truthful man, who weighs
every statement, questions every fact, and corrects every
inaccuracy.&rsquo;&nbsp; The liar at any rate recognizes that
recreation, not instruction, is the aim of conversation, and is
<!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>a far more civilized being than the blockhead who loudly
expresses his disbelief in a story which is told simply for the
amusement of the company.&nbsp; Mr. Mahaffy, however, makes an
exception in favour of the eminent specialist and tells us that
intelligent questions addressed to an astronomer, or a pure
mathematician, will elicit many curious facts which will
pleasantly beguile the time.&nbsp; Here, in the interest of
Society, we feel bound to enter a formal protest.&nbsp; Nobody,
even in the provinces, should ever be allowed to ask an
intelligent question about pure mathematics across a
dinner-table.&nbsp; A question of this kind is quite as bad as
inquiring suddenly about the state of a man&rsquo;s soul, a sort
of <i>coup</i> which, as Mr. Mahaffy remarks elsewhere,
&lsquo;many pious people have actually thought a decent
introduction to a conversation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As for the moral qualifications of a good talker, Mr. Mahaffy,
following the example of his great master, warns us against any
disproportionate excess of virtue.&nbsp; Modesty, for instance,
may easily become a social vice, and to be continually
apologizing for one&rsquo;s ignorance or stupidity is a grave
injury to conversation, for, &lsquo;what we want to learn from
each member is his free opinion on the subject in hand, not his
own estimate of the value of that opinion.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Simplicity, too, is not without its dangers.&nbsp; The <i>enfant
terrible</i>, with his shameless love of truth, the raw
country-bred girl who always says what she means, and the plain,
blunt man who makes a point of speaking his mind on every
possible occasion, without ever considering whether he has a mind
at all, are the fatal examples of what simplicity leads to.&nbsp;
Shyness may be a form of vanity, and reserve a development of
pride, and as for sympathy, what can be more detestable than the
man, or woman, <!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>who insists on agreeing with
everybody, and so makes &lsquo;a discussion, which implies
differences in opinion,&rsquo; absolutely impossible?&nbsp; Even
the unselfish listener is apt to become a bore.&nbsp;
&lsquo;These silent people,&rsquo; says Mr. Mahaffy, &lsquo;not
only take all they can get in Society for nothing, but they take
it without the smallest gratitude, and have the audacity
afterwards to censure those who have laboured for their
amusement.&rsquo;&nbsp; Tact, which is an exquisite sense of the
symmetry of things, is, according to Mr. Mahaffy, the highest and
best of all the moral conditions for conversation.&nbsp; The man
of tact, he most wisely remarks, &lsquo;will instinctively avoid
jokes about Blue Beard&rsquo; in the company of a woman who is a
man&rsquo;s third wife; he will never be guilty of talking like a
book, but will rather avoid too careful an attention to grammar
and the rounding of periods; he will cultivate the art of
graceful interruption, so as to prevent a subject being worn
threadbare by the aged or the inexperienced; and should he be
desirous of telling a story, he will look round and consider each
member of the party, and if there be a single stranger present
will forgo the pleasure of anecdotage rather than make the social
mistake of hurting even one of the guests.&nbsp; As for prepared
or premeditated art, Mr. Mahaffy has a great contempt for it and
tells us of a certain college don (let us hope not at Oxford or
Cambridge) who always carried a jest-book in his pocket and had
to refer to it when he wished to make a repartee.&nbsp; Great
wits, too, are often very cruel, and great humorists often very
vulgar, so it will be better to try and &lsquo;make good
conversation without any large help from these brilliant but
dangerous gifts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> one should talk
about persons, and <!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>in general Society about
things.&nbsp; The state of the weather is always an excusable
exordium, but it is convenient to have a paradox or heresy on the
subject always ready so as to direct the conversation into other
channels.&nbsp; Really domestic people are almost invariably bad
talkers as their very virtues in home life have dulled their
interest in outer things.&nbsp; The very best mothers will insist
on chattering of their babies and prattling about infant
education.&nbsp; In fact, most women do not take sufficient
interest in politics, just as most men are deficient in general
reading.&nbsp; Still, anybody can be made to talk, except the
very obstinate, and even a commercial traveller may be drawn out
and become quite interesting.&nbsp; As for Society small talk, it
is impossible, Mr. Mahaffy tells us, for any sound theory of
conversation to depreciate gossip, &lsquo;which is perhaps the
main factor in agreeable talk throughout Society.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The retailing of small personal points about great people always
gives pleasure, and if one is not fortunate enough to be an
Arctic traveller or an escaped Nihilist, the best thing one can
do is to relate some anecdote of &lsquo;Prince Bismarck, or King
Victor Emmanuel, or Mr. Gladstone.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the case of
meeting a genius and a Duke at dinner, the good talker will try
to raise himself to the level of the former and to bring the
latter down to his own level.&nbsp; To succeed among one&rsquo;s
social superiors one must have no hesitation in contradicting
them.&nbsp; Indeed, one should make bold criticisms and introduce
a bright and free tone into a Society whose grandeur and extreme
respectability make it, Mr. Mahaffy remarks, as pathetically as
inaccurately, &lsquo;perhaps somewhat dull.&rsquo;&nbsp; The best
conversationalists are those whose ancestors have been bilingual,
like the French and <!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>Irish, but the art of conversation is
really within the reach of almost every one, except those who are
morbidly truthful, or whose high moral worth requires to be
sustained by a permanent gravity of demeanour and a general
dullness of mind.</p>
<p>These are the broad principles contained in Mr.
Mahaffy&rsquo;s clever little book, and many of them will, no
doubt, commend themselves to our readers.&nbsp; The maxim,
&lsquo;If you find the company dull, blame yourself,&rsquo; seems
to us somewhat optimistic, and we have no sympathy at all with
the professional storyteller who is really a great bore at a
dinner-table; but Mr. Mahaffy is quite right in insisting that no
bright social intercourse is possible without equality, and it is
no objection to his book to say that it will not teach people how
to talk cleverly.&nbsp; It is not logic that makes men
reasonable, nor the science of ethics that makes men good, but it
is always useful to analyse, to formularize and to
investigate.&nbsp; The only thing to be regretted in the volume
is the arid and jejune character of the style.&nbsp; If Mr.
Mahaffy would only write as he talks, his book would be much
pleasanter reading.</p>

<h2>EARLY CHRISTIAN ART IN IRELAND<br />
(<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, December 17, 1887.)</h2>
<p>The want of a good series of popular handbooks on Irish art
has long been felt, the works of Sir William Wilde, Petrie and
others being somewhat too elaborate for the ordinary student; so
we are glad to notice the appearance, under the auspices<!-- page
82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>of
the Committee of Council on Education, of Miss Margaret
Stokes&rsquo;s useful little volume on the early Christian art of
her country.&nbsp; There is, of course, nothing particularly
original in Miss Stokes&rsquo;s book, nor can she be said to be a
very attractive or pleasing writer, but it is unfair to look for
originality in primers, and the charm of the illustrations fully
atones for the somewhat heavy and pedantic character of the
style.</p>
<p>This early Christian art of Ireland is full of interest to the
artist, the arch&aelig;ologist and the historian.&nbsp; In its
rudest forms, such as the little iron hand-bell, the plain stone
chalice and the rough wooden staff, it brings us back to the
simplicity of the primitive Christian Church, while to the period
of its highest development we owe the great masterpieces of
Celtic metal-work.&nbsp; The stone chalice is now replaced by the
chalice of silver and gold; the iron bell has its jewel-studded
shrine, and the rough staff its gorgeous casing; rich caskets and
splendid bindings preserve the holy books of the Saints and,
instead of the rudely carved symbol of the early missionaries, we
have such beautiful works of art as the processional cross of
Cong Abbey.&nbsp; Beautiful this cross certainly is with its
delicate intricacy of ornamentation, its grace of proportion and
its marvel of mere workmanship, nor is there any doubt about its
history.&nbsp; From the inscriptions on it, which are
corroborated by the annals of Innisfallen and the book of
Clonmacnoise, we learn that it was made for King Turlough
O&rsquo;Connor by a native artist under the superintendence of
Bishop O&rsquo;Duffy, its primary object being to enshrine a
portion of the true cross that was sent to the king in
1123.&nbsp; Brought to Cong some years afterwards, probably by
the archbishop, <!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>who died there in 1150, it was
concealed at the time of the Reformation, but at the beginning of
the present century was still in the possession of the last
abbot, and at his death it was purchased by Professor MacCullagh
and presented by him to the museum of the Royal Irish
Academy.&nbsp; This wonderful work is alone well worth a visit to
Dublin, but not less lovely is the chalice of Ardagh, a
two-handled silver cup, absolutely classical in its perfect
purity of form, and decorated with gold and amber and crystal and
with varieties of <i>cloisonn&eacute;</i> and
<i>champlev&eacute;</i> enamel.&nbsp; There is no mention of this
cup, or of the so-called Tara brooch, in ancient Irish
history.&nbsp; All that we know of them is that they were found
accidentally, the former by a boy who was digging potatoes near
the old Rath of Ardagh, the latter by a poor child who picked it
up near the seashore.&nbsp; They both, however, belong probably
to the tenth century.</p>
<p>Of all these works, as well as of the bell shrines,
book-covers, sculptured crosses and illuminated designs in
manuscripts, excellent pictures are given in Miss Stokes&rsquo;s
handbook.&nbsp; The extremely interesting <i>Fiachal Phadrig</i>,
or shrine of St. Patrick&rsquo;s tooth, might have been figured
and noted as an interesting example of the survival of ornament,
and one of the old miniatures of the scribe or Evangelist writing
would have given an additional interest to the chapter on Irish
MSS.&nbsp; On the whole, however, the book is wonderfully well
illustrated, and the ordinary art student will be able to get
some useful suggestions from it.&nbsp; Indeed, Miss Stokes,
echoing the aspirations of many of the great Irish
arch&aelig;ologists, looks forward to the revival of a native
Irish school in architecture, sculpture, metal-work and
painting.&nbsp; Such an <!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>aspiration is, of course, very
laudable, but there is always a danger of these revivals being
merely artificial reproductions, and it may be questioned whether
the peculiar forms of Irish ornamentation could be made at all
expressive of the modern spirit.&nbsp; A recent writer on house
decoration has gravely suggested that the British householder
should take his meals in a Celtic dining-room adorned with a dado
of Ogham inscriptions, and such wicked proposals may serve as a
warning to all who fancy that the reproduction of a form
necessarily implies a revival of the spirit that gave the form
life and meaning, and who fail to recognize the difference
between art and anachronisms.&nbsp; Miss Stokes&rsquo;s proposal
for an ark-shaped church in which the mural painter is to repeat
the arcades and &lsquo;follow the architectural compositions of
the grand pages of the Eusebian canons in the Book of
Kells,&rsquo; has, of course, nothing grotesque about it, but it
is not probable that the artistic genius of the Irish people
will, even when &lsquo;the land has rest,&rsquo; find in such
interesting imitations its healthiest or best expression.&nbsp;
Still, there are certain elements of beauty in ancient Irish art
that the modern artist would do well to study.&nbsp; The value of
the intricate illuminations in the Book of Kells, as far as their
adaptability to modern designs and modern material goes, has been
very much overrated, but in the ancient Irish torques, brooches,
pins, clasps and the like, the modern goldsmith will find a rich
and, comparatively speaking, an untouched field; and now that the
Celtic spirit has become the leaven of our politics, there is no
reason why it should not contribute something to our decorative
art.&nbsp; This result, however, will not be obtained by a
patriotic misuse of old designs, and even the most <!-- page

his dining-room with a dado of Oghams.</p>

<h2>MADAME RISTORI<br />
(<i>Woman&rsquo;s World</i>, January 1888.)</h2>
<p>Madame Ristori&rsquo;s <i>Etudes et Souvenirs</i> is one of
the most delightful books on the stage that has appeared since
Lady Martin&rsquo;s charming volume on the Shakespearian
heroines.&nbsp; It is often said that actors leave nothing behind
them but a barren name and a withered wreath; that they subsist
simply upon the applause of the moment; that they are ultimately
doomed to the oblivion of old play-bills; and that their art, in
a word, dies with them, and shares their own mortality.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Chippendale, the cabinet-maker,&rsquo; says the clever
author of <i>Obiter Dicta</i>, &lsquo;is more potent than Garrick
the actor.&nbsp; The vivacity of the latter no longer charms
(save in Boswell); the chairs of the former still render rest
impossible in a hundred homes.&rsquo;&nbsp; This view, however,
seems to me to be exaggerated.&nbsp; It rests on the assumption
that acting is simply a mimetic art, and takes no account of its
imaginative and intellectual basis.&nbsp; It is quite true, of
course, that the personality of the player passes away, and with
it that pleasure-giving power by virtue of which the arts
exist.&nbsp; Yet the artistic method of a great actor
survives.&nbsp; It lives on in tradition, and becomes part of the
science of a school.&nbsp; It has all the intellectual life of a
principle.&nbsp; In England, at the present moment, the influence
of Garrick on <!-- page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 86</span>our actors is far stronger than that
of Reynolds on our painters of portraits, and if we turn to
France it is easy to discern the tradition of Talma, but where is
the tradition of David?</p>
<p>Madame Ristori&rsquo;s memoirs, then, have not merely the
charm that always attaches to the autobiography of a brilliant
and beautiful woman, but have also a definite and distinct
artistic value.&nbsp; Her analysis of the character of Lady
Macbeth, for instance, is full of psychological interest, and
shows us that the subtleties of Shakespearian criticism are not
necessarily confined to those who have views on weak endings and
rhyming tags, but may also be suggested by the art of acting
itself.&nbsp; The author of <i>Obiter Dicta</i> seeks to deny to
actors all critical insight and all literary appreciation.&nbsp;
The actor, he tells us, is art&rsquo;s slave, not her child, and
lives entirely outside literature, &lsquo;with its words for ever
on his lips, and none of its truths engraven on his
heart.&rsquo;&nbsp; But this seems to me to be a harsh and
reckless generalization.&nbsp; Indeed, so far from agreeing with
it, I would be inclined to say that the mere artistic process of
acting, the translation of literature back again into life, and
the presentation of thought under the conditions of action, is in
itself a critical method of a very high order; nor do I think
that a study of the careers of our great English actors will
really sustain the charge of want of literary appreciation.&nbsp;
It may be true that actors pass too quickly away from the form,
in order to get at the feeling that gives the form beauty and
colour, and that, where the literary critic studies the language,
the actor looks simply for the life; and yet, how well the great
actors have appreciated that marvellous music of words, which in
Shakespeare, at any rate, is so vital an <!-- page 87--><a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>element of
poetic power, if, indeed, it be not equally so in the case of all
who have any claim to be regarded as true poets.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
sensual life of verse,&rsquo; says Keats, in a dramatic criticism
published in the <i>Champion</i>, &lsquo;springs warm from the
lips of Kean, and to one learned in Shakespearian hieroglyphics,
learned in the spiritual portion of those lines to which Kean
adds a sensual grandeur, his tongue must seem to have robbed the
Hybla bees and left them honeyless.&rsquo;&nbsp; This particular
feeling, of which Keats speaks, is familiar to all who have heard
Salvini, Sarah Bernhardt, Ristori, or any of the great artists of
our day, and it is a feeling that one cannot, I think, gain
merely by reading the passage to oneself.&nbsp; For my own part,
I must confess that it was not until I heard Sarah Bernhardt in
<i>Ph&egrave;dre</i> that I absolutely realized the sweetness of
the music of Racine.&nbsp; As for Mr. Birrell&rsquo;s statement
that actors have the words of literature for ever on their lips,
but none of its truths engraved on their hearts, all that one can
say is that, if it be true, it is a defect which actors share
with the majority of literary critics.</p>
<p>The account Madame Ristori gives of her own struggles, voyages
and adventures, is very pleasant reading indeed.&nbsp; The child
of poor actors, she made her first appearance when she was three
months old, being brought on in a hamper as a New Year&rsquo;s
gift to a selfish old gentleman who would not forgive his
daughter for having married for love.&nbsp; As, however, she
began to cry long before the hamper was opened, the comedy became
a farce, to the immense amusement of the public.&nbsp; She next
appeared in a medi&aelig;val melodrama, being then three years of
age, and was so terrified at the machinations of the villain that
she ran away at <!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>the most critical moment.&nbsp;
However, her stage-fright seems to have disappeared, and we find
her playing Silvio Pellico&rsquo;s <i>Francesca da Rimini</i> at
fifteen, and at eighteen making her <i>d&eacute;but</i> as Marie
Stuart.&nbsp; At this time the naturalism of the French method
was gradually displacing the artificial elocution and academic
poses of the Italian school of acting.&nbsp; Madame Ristori seems
to have tried to combine simplicity with style, and the passion
of nature with the self-restraint of the artist.&nbsp;
&lsquo;J&rsquo;ai voulu fondre les deux mani&egrave;res,&rsquo;
she tells us, &lsquo;car je sentais que toutes choses
&eacute;tant susceptibles de progr&egrave;s, l&rsquo;art
dramatique aussi &eacute;tait appel&eacute; &agrave; subir des
transformations.&rsquo;&nbsp; The natural development, however,
of the Italian drama was almost arrested by the ridiculous
censorship of plays then existing in each town under Austrian or
Papal rule.&nbsp; The slightest allusion to the sentiment of
nationality or the spirit of freedom was prohibited.&nbsp; Even
the word <i>patria</i> was regarded as treasonable, and Madame
Ristori tells us an amusing story of the indignation of a censor
who was asked to license a play, in which a dumb man returns home
after an absence of many years, and on his entrance upon the
stage makes gestures expressive of his joy in seeing his native
land once more.&nbsp; &lsquo;Gestures of this kind,&rsquo; said
the censor, &lsquo;are obviously of a very revolutionary
tendency, and cannot possibly be allowed.&nbsp; The only gestures
that I could think of permitting would be gestures expressive of
a dumb man&rsquo;s delight in scenery generally.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
stage directions were accordingly altered, and the word
&lsquo;landscape&rsquo; substituted for &lsquo;native
land&rsquo;!&nbsp; Another censor was extremely severe on an
unfortunate poet who had used the expression &lsquo;the beautiful
Italian sky,&rsquo; and explained to him that <!-- page 89--><a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>&lsquo;the
beautiful Lombardo-Venetian sky&rsquo; was the proper official
expression to use.&nbsp; Poor Gregory in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>
had to be rechristened, because Gregory is a name dear to the
Popes; and the</p>
<blockquote><p>Here I have a pilot&rsquo;s thumb,<br />
Wrecked as homeward he did come,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>of the first witch in <i>Macbeth</i> was ruthlessly struck out
as containing an obvious allusion to the steersman of St.
Peter&rsquo;s bark.&nbsp; Finally, bored and bothered by the
political and theological Dogberrys of the day, with their inane
prejudices, their solemn stupidity, and their entire ignorance of
the conditions necessary for the growth of sane and healthy art,
Madame Ristori made up her mind to leave the stage.&nbsp; She,
however, was extremely anxious to appear once before a Parisian
audience, Paris being at that time the centre of dramatic
activity, and after some consideration left Italy for France in
the year 1855.&nbsp; There she seems to have been a great
success, particularly in the part of Myrrha; classical without
being cold, artistic without being academic, she brought to the
interpretation of the character of Alfieri&rsquo;s great heroine
the colour-element of passion, the form-element of style.&nbsp;
Jules Janin was loud in his praises, the Emperor begged Ristori
to join the troupe of the Com&eacute;die Fran&ccedil;aise, and
Rachel, with the strange narrow jealousy of her nature, trembled
for her laurels.&nbsp; Myrrha was followed by Marie Stuart, and
Marie Stuart by Medea.&nbsp; In the latter part Madame Ristori
excited the greatest enthusiasm.&nbsp; Ary Scheffer designed her
costumes for her; and the Niobe that stands in the Uffizi Gallery
at Florence, suggested to Madame Ristori her famous pose in the
scene with the children.&nbsp; She would not consent, however, to
remain in France, and we find her subsequently playing in almost
every country in <!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>the world from Egypt to Mexico, from
Denmark to Honolulu.&nbsp; Her representations of classical plays
seem to have been always immensely admired.&nbsp; When she played
at Athens, the King offered to arrange for a performance in the
beautiful old theatre of Dionysos, and during her tour in
Portugal she produced <i>Medea</i> before the University of
Coimbra.&nbsp; Her description of the latter engagement is
extremely interesting.&nbsp; On her arrival at the University,
she was received by the entire body of the undergraduates, who
still wear a costume almost medi&aelig;val in character.&nbsp;
Some of them came on the stage in the course of the play as the
handmaidens of Creusa, hiding their black beards beneath heavy
veils, and as soon as they had finished their parts they took
their places gravely among the audience, to Madame
Ristori&rsquo;s horror, still in their Greek dress, but with
their veils thrown back and smoking long cigars.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ce
n&rsquo;est pas la premi&egrave;re fois,&rsquo; she says,
&lsquo;que j&rsquo;ai d&ucirc; emp&ecirc;cher, par un effort de
volont&eacute;, la trag&eacute;die de se terminer en
farce.&rsquo;&nbsp; Very interesting, also, is her account of the
production of Montanelli&rsquo;s <i>Camma</i>, and she tells an
amusing story of the arrest of the author by the French police on
the charge of murder, in consequence of a telegram she sent to
him in which the words &lsquo;body of the victim&rsquo;
occurred.&nbsp; Indeed, the whole book is full of cleverly
written stories, and admirable criticisms on dramatic art.&nbsp;
I have quoted from the French version, which happens to be the
one that lies before me, but whether in French or Italian the
book is one of the most fascinating autobiographies that has
appeared for some time, even in an age like ours when literary
egotism has been brought to such an exquisite pitch of
perfection.</p>

91</span>ENGLISH POETESSES<br />
(<i>Queen</i>, December 8, 1888.)</h2>
<p>England has given to the world one great poetess, Elizabeth
Barrett Browning.&nbsp; By her side Mr. Swinburne would place
Miss Christina Rossetti, whose New Year hymn he describes as so
much the noblest of sacred poems in our language, that there is
none which comes near it enough to stand second.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
is a hymn,&rsquo; he tells us, &lsquo;touched as with the fire,
and bathed as in the light of sunbeams, tuned as to chords and
cadences of refluent sea-music beyond reach of harp and organ,
large echoes of the serene and sonorous tides of
heaven.&rsquo;&nbsp; Much as I admire Miss Rossetti&rsquo;s work,
her subtle choice of words, her rich imagery, her artistic
na&iuml;vet&eacute;, wherein curious notes of strangeness and
simplicity are fantastically blended together, I cannot but think
that Mr. Swinburne has, with noble and natural loyalty, placed
her on too lofty a pedestal.&nbsp; To me, she is simply a very
delightful artist in poetry.&nbsp; This is indeed something so
rare that when we meet it we cannot fail to love it, but it is
not everything.&nbsp; Beyond it and above it are higher and more
sunlit heights of song, a larger vision, and an ampler air, a
music at once more passionate and more profound, a creative
energy that is born of the spirit, a winged rapture that is born
of the soul, a force and fervour of mere utterance that has all
the wonder of the prophet, and not a little of the consecration
of the priest.</p>
<p>Mrs. Browning is unapproachable by any woman who has ever
touched lyre or blown through reed since the days of the great
&AElig;olian poetess.&nbsp; But <!-- page 92--><a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>Sappho, who
to the antique world was a pillar of flame, is to us but a pillar
of shadow.&nbsp; Of her poems, burnt with other most precious
work by Byzantine Emperor and by Roman Pope, only a few fragments
remain.&nbsp; Possibly they lie mouldering in the scented
darkness of an Egyptian tomb, clasped in the withered hand of
some long-dead lover.&nbsp; Some Greek monk at Athos may even now
be poring over an ancient manuscript, whose crabbed characters
conceal lyric or ode by her whom the Greeks spoke of as
&lsquo;the Poetess&rsquo; just as they termed Homer &lsquo;the
Poet,&rsquo; who was to them the tenth Muse, the flower of the
Graces, the child of Er&ocirc;s, and the pride of
Hellas&mdash;Sappho, with the sweet voice, the bright, beautiful
eyes, the dark hyacinth coloured hair.&nbsp; But, practically,
the work of the marvellous singer of Lesbos is entirely lost to
us.</p>
<p>We have a few rose-leaves out of her garden, that is
all.&nbsp; Literature nowadays survives marble and bronze, but in
the old days, in spite of the Roman poet&rsquo;s noble boast, it
was not so.&nbsp; The fragile clay vases of the Greeks still keep
for us pictures of Sappho, delicately painted in black and red
and white; but of her song we have only the echo of an echo.</p>
<p>Of all the women of history, Mrs. Browning is the only one
that we could name in any possible or remote conjunction with
Sappho.</p>
<p>Sappho was undoubtedly a far more flawless and perfect
artist.&nbsp; She stirred the whole antique world more than Mrs.
Browning ever stirred our modern age.&nbsp; Never had Love such a
singer.&nbsp; Even in the few lines that remain to us the passion
seems to scorch and burn.&nbsp; But, as unjust Time, who has
crowned her with the barren laurels of fame, has twined with them
the dull poppies of oblivion, let <!-- page 93--><a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>us turn from
the mere memory of a poetess to one whose song still remains to
us as an imperishable glory to our literature; to her who heard
the cry of the children from dark mine and crowded factory, and
made England weep over its little ones; who, in the feigned
sonnets from the Portuguese, sang of the spiritual mystery of
Love, and of the intellectual gifts that Love brings to the soul;
who had faith in all that is worthy, and enthusiasm for all that
is great, and pity for all that suffers; who wrote the <i>Vision
of Poets</i> and <i>Casa Guidi Windows</i> and <i>Aurora
Leigh</i>.</p>
<p>As one, to whom I owe my love of poetry no less than my love
of country, said of her:</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still
on our ears<br />
The clear &lsquo;Excelsior&rsquo; from a woman&rsquo;s lip<br />
Rings out across the Apennines, although<br />
The woman&rsquo;s brow lies pale and cold in death<br />
With all the mighty marble dead in Florence.<br />
For while great songs can stir the hearts of men,<br />
Spreading their full vibrations through the world<br />
In ever-widening circles till they reach<br />
The Throne of God, and song becomes a prayer,<br />
And prayer brings down the liberating strength<br />
That kindles nations to heroic deeds,<br />
She lives&mdash;the great-souled poetess who saw<br />
From Casa Guidi windows Freedom dawn<br />
On Italy, and gave the glory back<br />
In sunrise hymns to all Humanity!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She lives indeed, and not alone in the heart of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s England, but in the heart of Dante&rsquo;s
Italy also.&nbsp; To Greek literature she owed her scholarly
culture, but modern Italy created her human passion for
Liberty.&nbsp; When she crossed the Alps she became filled with a
new ardour, and from that fine, eloquent mouth, that we can still
see in her portraits, broke forth such a noble and majestic
outburst of lyrical song as had not been heard from woman&rsquo;s
lips for more than two thousand years.&nbsp; It <!-- page 94--><a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>is pleasant
to think that an English poetess was to a certain extent a real
factor in bringing about that unity of Italy that was
Dante&rsquo;s dream, and if Florence drove her great singer into
exile, she at least welcomed within her walls the later singer
that England had sent to her.</p>
<p>If one were asked the chief qualities of Mrs. Browning&rsquo;s
work, one would say, as Mr. Swinburne said of Byron&rsquo;s, its
sincerity and its strength.&nbsp; Faults it, of course,
possesses.&nbsp; &lsquo;She would rhyme moon to table,&rsquo;
used to be said of her in jest; and certainly no more monstrous
rhymes are to be found in all literature than some of those we
come across in Mrs. Browning&rsquo;s poems.&nbsp; But her
ruggedness was never the result of carelessness.&nbsp; It was
deliberate, as her letters to Mr. Horne show very clearly.&nbsp;
She refused to sandpaper her muse.&nbsp; She disliked facile
smoothness and artificial polish.&nbsp; In her very rejection of
art she was an artist.&nbsp; She intended to produce a certain
effect by certain means, and she succeeded; and her indifference
to complete assonance in rhyme often gives a splendid richness to
her verse, and brings into it a pleasurable element of
surprise.</p>
<p>In philosophy she was a Platonist, in politics an
Opportunist.&nbsp; She attached herself to no particular
party.&nbsp; She loved the people when they were king-like, and
kings when they showed themselves to be men.&nbsp; Of the real
value and motive of poetry she had a most exalted idea.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Poetry,&rsquo; she says, in the preface of one of her
volumes, &lsquo;has been as serious a thing to me as life itself;
and life has been a very serious thing.&nbsp; There has been no
playing at skittles for me in either.&nbsp; I never mistook
pleasure for the final cause of poetry, nor leisure for the hour
of the poet.&nbsp; I have done my work so far, not as mere hand
and head work apart from the personal being, <!-- page 95--><a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>but as the
completest expression of that being to which I could
attain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It certainly is her completest expression, and through it she
realizes her fullest perfection.&nbsp; &lsquo;The poet,&rsquo;
she says elsewhere, &lsquo;is at once richer and poorer than he
used to be; he wears better broadcloth, but speaks no more
oracles.&rsquo;&nbsp; These words give us the keynote to her view
of the poet&rsquo;s mission.&nbsp; He was to utter Divine
oracles, to be at once inspired prophet and holy priest; and as
such we may, I think, without exaggeration, conceive her.&nbsp;
She was a Sibyl delivering a message to the world, sometimes
through stammering lips, and once at least with blinded eyes, yet
always with the true fire and fervour of lofty and unshaken
faith, always with the great raptures of a spiritual nature, the
high ardours of an impassioned soul.&nbsp; As we read her best
poems we feel that, though Apollo&rsquo;s shrine be empty and the
bronze tripod overthrown, and the vale of Delphi desolate, still
the Pythia is not dead.&nbsp; In our own age she has sung for us,
and this land gave her new birth.&nbsp; Indeed, Mrs. Browning is
the wisest of the Sibyls, wiser even than that mighty figure whom
Michael Angelo has painted on the roof of the Sistine Chapel at
Rome, poring over the scroll of mystery, and trying to decipher
the secrets of Fate; for she realized that, while knowledge is
power, suffering is part of knowledge.</p>
<p>To her influence, almost as much as to the higher education of
women, I would be inclined to attribute the really remarkable
awakening of woman&rsquo;s song that characterizes the latter
half of our century in England.&nbsp; No country has ever had so
many poetesses at once.&nbsp; Indeed, when one remembers that the
Greeks had only nine muses, one is sometimes apt to fancy that we
have too many.&nbsp; And <!-- page 96--><a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>yet the work
done by women in the sphere of poetry is really of a very high
standard of excellence.&nbsp; In England we have always been
prone to underrate the value of tradition in literature.&nbsp; In
our eagerness to find a new voice and a fresh mode of music, we
have forgotten how beautiful Echo may be.&nbsp; We look first for
individuality and personality, and these are, indeed, the chief
characteristics of the masterpieces of our literature, either in
prose or verse; but deliberate culture and a study of the best
models, if united to an artistic temperament and a nature
susceptible of exquisite impressions, may produce much that is
admirable, much that is worthy of praise.&nbsp; It would be quite
impossible to give a complete catalogue of all the women who
since Mrs. Browning&rsquo;s day have tried lute and lyre.&nbsp;
Mrs. Pfeiffer, Mrs. Hamilton King, Mrs. Augusta Webster, Graham
Tomson, Miss Mary Robinson, Jean Ingelow, Miss May Kendall, Miss
Nesbit, Miss May Probyn, Mrs. Craik, Mrs. Meynell, Miss Chapman,
and many others have done really good work in poetry, either in
the grave Dorian mode of thoughtful and intellectual verse, or in
the light and graceful forms of old French song, or in the
romantic manner of antique ballad, or in that
&lsquo;moment&rsquo;s monument,&rsquo; as Rossetti called it, the
intense and concentrated sonnet.&nbsp; Occasionally one is
tempted to wish that the quick, artistic faculty that women
undoubtedly possess developed itself somewhat more in prose and
somewhat less in verse.&nbsp; Poetry is for our highest moods,
when we wish to be with the gods, and in our poetry nothing but
the very best should satisfy us; but prose is for our daily
bread, and the lack of good prose is one of the chief blots on
our culture.&nbsp; French prose, even in the hands of the most
ordinary writers, is always <!-- page 97--><a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>readable, but
English prose is detestable.&nbsp; We have a few, a very few,
masters, such as they are.&nbsp; We have Carlyle, who should not
be imitated; and Mr. Pater, who, through the subtle perfection of
his form, is inimitable absolutely; and Mr. Froude, who is
useful; and Matthew Arnold, who is a model; and Mr. George
Meredith, who is a warning; and Mr. Lang, who is the divine
amateur; and Mr. Stevenson, who is the humane artist; and Mr.
Ruskin, whose rhythm and colour and fine rhetoric and marvellous
music of words are entirely unattainable.&nbsp; But the general
prose that one reads in magazines and in newspapers is terribly
dull and cumbrous, heavy in movement and uncouth or exaggerated
in expression.&nbsp; Possibly some day our women of letters will
apply themselves more definitely to prose.</p>
<p>Their light touch, and exquisite ear, and delicate sense of
balance and proportion would be of no small service to us.&nbsp;
I can fancy women bringing a new manner into our literature.</p>
<p>However, we have to deal here with women as poetesses, and it
is interesting to note that, though Mrs. Browning&rsquo;s
influence undoubtedly contributed very largely to the development
of this new song-movement, if I may so term it, still there seems
to have been never a time during the last three hundred years
when the women of this kingdom did not cultivate, if not the art,
at least the habit, of writing poetry.</p>
<p>Who the first English poetess was I cannot say.&nbsp; I
believe it was the Abbess Juliana Berners, who lived in the
fifteenth century; but I have no doubt that Mr. Freeman would be
able at a moment&rsquo;s notice to produce some wonderful Saxon
or Norman poetess, whose works cannot be read without a <!-- page
98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>glossary, and even with its aid are completely
unintelligible.&nbsp; For my own part, I am content with the
Abbess Juliana, who wrote enthusiastically about hawking; and
after her I would mention Anne Askew, who in prison and on the
eve of her fiery martyrdom wrote a ballad that has, at any rate,
a pathetic and historical interest.&nbsp; Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s
&lsquo;most sweet and sententious ditty&rsquo; on Mary Stuart is
highly praised by Puttenham, a contemporary critic, as an example
of &lsquo;Exargasia, or the Gorgeous in Literature,&rsquo; which
somehow seems a very suitable epithet for such a great
Queen&rsquo;s poems.&nbsp; The term she applies to the
unfortunate Queen of Scots, &lsquo;the daughter of debate,&rsquo;
has, of course, long since passed into literature.&nbsp; The
Countess of Pembroke, Sir Philip Sidney&rsquo;s sister, was much
admired as a poetess in her day.</p>
<p>In 1613 the &lsquo;learned, virtuous, and truly noble
ladie,&rsquo; Elizabeth Carew, published a <i>Tragedie of
Marian</i>, <i>the Faire Queene of Jewry</i>, and a few years
later the &lsquo;noble ladie Diana Primrose&rsquo; wrote <i>A
Chain of Pearl</i>, which is a panegyric on the &lsquo;peerless
graces&rsquo; of Gloriana.&nbsp; Mary Morpeth, the friend and
admirer of Drummond of Hawthornden; Lady Mary Wroth, to whom Ben
Jonson dedicated <i>The Alchemist</i>; and the Princess
Elizabeth, the sister of Charles I., should also be
mentioned.</p>
<p>After the Restoration women applied themselves with still
greater ardour to the study of literature and the practice of
poetry.&nbsp; Margaret, Duchess of Newcastle, was a true woman of
letters, and some of her verses are extremely pretty and
graceful.&nbsp; Mrs. Aphra Behn was the first Englishwoman who
adopted literature as a regular profession.&nbsp; Mrs. Katharine
Philips, according to Mr. Gosse, invented sentimentality.&nbsp;
As she was praised by Dryden, <!-- page 99--><a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>and mourned
by Cowley, let us hope she may be forgiven.&nbsp; Keats came
across her poems at Oxford when he was writing <i>Endymion</i>,
and found in one of them &lsquo;a most delicate fancy of the
Fletcher kind&rsquo;; but I fear nobody reads the Matchless
Orinda now.&nbsp; Of Lady Winchelsea&rsquo;s <i>Nocturnal
Reverie</i> Wordsworth said that, with the exception of
Pope&rsquo;s <i>Windsor Forest</i>, it was the only poem of the
period intervening between <i>Paradise Lost</i> and
Thomson&rsquo;s <i>Seasons</i> that contained a single new image
of external nature.&nbsp; Lady Rachel Russell, who may be said to
have inaugurated the letter-writing literature of England; Eliza
Haywood, who is immortalized by the badness of her work, and has
a niche in <i>The Dunciad</i>; and the Marchioness of Wharton,
whose poems Waller said he admired, are very remarkable types,
the finest of them being, of course, the first named, who was a
woman of heroic mould and of a most noble dignity of nature.</p>
<p>Indeed, though the English poetesses up to the time of Mrs.
Browning cannot be said to have produced any work of absolute
genius, they are certainly interesting figures, fascinating
subjects for study.&nbsp; Amongst them we find Lady Mary Wortley
Montague, who had all the caprice of Cleopatra, and whose letters
are delightful reading; Mrs. Centlivre, who wrote one brilliant
comedy; Lady Anne Barnard, whose <i>Auld Robin Gray</i> was
described by Sir Walter Scott as &lsquo;worth all the dialogues
Corydon and Phillis have together spoken from the days of
Theocritus downwards,&rsquo; and is certainly a very beautiful
and touching poem; Esther Vanhomrigh and Hester Johnson, the
Vanessa and the Stella of Dean Swift&rsquo;s life; Mrs. Thrale,
the friend of the great lexicographer; the worthy Mrs. Barbauld;
the excellent Miss Hannah <!-- page 100--><a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>More; the
industrious Joanna Baillie; the admirable Mrs. Chapone, whose
<i>Ode to Solitude</i> always fills me with the wildest passion
for society, and who will at least be remembered as the patroness
of the establishment at which Becky Sharp was educated; Miss Anna
Seward, who was called &lsquo;The Swan of Lichfield&rsquo;; poor
L. E. L. whom Disraeli described in one of his clever letters to
his sister as &lsquo;the personification of Brompton&mdash;pink
satin dress, white satin shoes, red cheeks, snub nose, and her
hair <i>&agrave; la</i> Sappho&rsquo;; Mrs. Ratcliffe, who
introduced the romantic novel, and has consequently much to
answer for; the beautiful Duchess of Devonshire, of whom Gibbon
said that she was &lsquo;made for something better than a
Duchess&rsquo;; the two wonderful sisters, Lady Dufferin and Mrs.
Norton; Mrs. Tighe, whose <i>Psyche</i> Keats read with pleasure;
Constantia Grierson, a marvellous blue-stocking in her time; Mrs.
Hemans; pretty, charming &lsquo;Perdita,&rsquo; who flirted
alternately with poetry and the Prince Regent, played divinely in
the <i>Winter&rsquo;s Tale</i>, was brutally attacked by Gifford,
and has left us a pathetic little poem on a Snowdrop; and Emily
Bront&euml;, whose poems are instinct with tragic power, and seem
often on the verge of being great.</p>
<p>Old fashions in literature are not so pleasant as old fashions
in dress.&nbsp; I like the costume of the age of powder better
than the poetry of the age of Pope.&nbsp; But if one adopts the
historical standpoint&mdash;and this is, indeed, the only
standpoint from which we can ever form a fair estimate of work
that is not absolutely of the highest order&mdash;we cannot fail
to see that many of the English poetesses who preceded Mrs.
Browning were women of no ordinary talent, and that if the
majority of them looked upon poetry simply as a department of
<i>belles lettres</i>, so in <!-- page 101--><a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>most cases
did their contemporaries.&nbsp; Since Mrs. Browning&rsquo;s day

<h2>VENUS OR VICTORY<br />
(<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, February 24, 1888.)</h2>
<p>There are certain problems in arch&aelig;ology that seem to
possess a real romantic interest, and foremost among these is the
question of the so-called Venus of Melos.&nbsp; Who is she, this
marble mutilated goddess whom Gautier loved, to whom Heine bent
his knee?&nbsp; What sculptor wrought her, and for what
shrine?&nbsp; Whose hands walled her up in that rude niche where
the Melian peasant found her?&nbsp; What symbol of her divinity
did she carry?&nbsp; Was it apple of gold or shield of
bronze?&nbsp; Where is her city and what was her name among gods
and men?&nbsp; The last writer on this fascinating subject is Mr.
Stillman, who in a most interesting book recently published in
America, claims that the work of art in question is no sea-born
and foam-born Aphrodite, but the very Victory Without Wings that
once stood in the little chapel outside the gates of the
Acropolis at Athens.&nbsp; So long ago as 1826, that is to say
six years after the discovery of the statue, the Venus hypothesis
was violently attacked by Millingen, and from that time to this
the battle of the arch&aelig;ologists has never ceased.&nbsp; Mr.
Stillman, who fights, of course, under Millingen&rsquo;s banner,
points out that the statue is not of the Venus type <!-- page
102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>at
all, being far too heroic in character to correspond to the Greek
conception of Aphrodite at any period of their artistic
development, but that it agrees distinctly with certain
well-known statues of Victory, such as the celebrated
&lsquo;Victory of Brescia.&rsquo;&nbsp; The latter is in bronze,
is later, and has the wings, but the type is unmistakable, and
though not a reproduction it is certainly a recollection of the
Melian statue.&nbsp; The representation of Victory on the coin of
Agathocles is also obviously of the Melian type, and in the
museum of Naples is a terra-cotta Victory in almost the identical
action and drapery.&nbsp; As for Dumont d&rsquo;Urville&rsquo;s
statement that, when the statue was discovered, one hand held an
apple and the other a fold of the drapery, the latter is
obviously a mistake, and the whole evidence on the subject is so
contradictory that no reliance can be placed on the statement
made by the French Consul and the French naval officers, none of
whom seems to have taken the trouble to ascertain whether the arm
and hand now in the Louvre were really found in the same niche as
the statue at all.&nbsp; At any rate, these fragments seem to be
of extremely inferior workmanship, and they are so imperfect that
they are quite worthless as data for measure or opinion.&nbsp; So
far, Mr. Stillman is on old ground.&nbsp; His real artistic
discovery is this.&nbsp; In working about the Acropolis of
Athens, some years ago, he photographed among other sculptures
the mutilated Victories in the Temple of Nik&egrave; Apteros, the
&lsquo;Wingless Victory,&rsquo; the little Ionic temple in which
stood that statue of Victory of which it was said that
&lsquo;<i>the Athenians made her without wings that she might
never leave Athens</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; Looking over the photographs
afterwards, when the impression of the comparatively diminutive
size had passed, he was struck with the close resemblance <!--
page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>of the type to that of the Melian statue.&nbsp; Now,
this resemblance is so striking that it cannot be questioned by
any one who has an eye for form.&nbsp; There are the same large
heroic proportions, the same ampleness of physical development,
and the same treatment of drapery, and there is also that perfect
spiritual kinship which, to any true antiquarian, is one of the
most valuable modes of evidence.&nbsp; Now it is generally
admitted on both sides that the Melian statue is probably Attic
in its origin, and belongs certainly to the period between
Phidias and Praxiteles, that is to say, to the age of Scopas, if
it be not actually the work of Scopas himself; and as it is to
Scopas that these bas-reliefs have been always attributed, the
similarity of style can, on Mr. Stillman&rsquo;s hypothesis, be
easily accounted for.</p>
<p>As regards the appearance of the statue in Melos, Mr. Stillman
points out that Melos belonged to Athens as late as she had any
Greek allegiance, and that it is probable that the statue was
sent there for concealment on the occasion of some siege or
invasion.&nbsp; When this took place, Mr. Stillman does not
pretend to decide with any degree of certainty, but it is evident
that it must have been subsequent to the establishment of the
Roman hegemony, as the brickwork of the niche in which the statue
was found is clearly Roman in character, and before the time of
Pausanias and Pliny, as neither of these antiquaries mentions the
statue.&nbsp; Accepting, then, the statue as that of the Victory
Without Wings, Mr. Stillman agrees with Millingen in supposing
that in her left hand she held a bronze shield, the lower rim of
which rested on the left knee where some marks of the kind are
easily recognizable, while with her right hand she <!-- page
104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>traced, or had just finished tracing, the names of the
great heroes of Athens.&nbsp; Valentin&rsquo;s objection, that if
this were so the left thigh would incline outwards so as to
secure a balance, Mr. Stillman meets partly by the analogy of the
Victory of Brescia and partly by the evidence of Nature herself;
for he has had a model photographed in the same position as the
statue and holding a shield in the manner he proposes in his
restoration.&nbsp; The result is precisely the contrary to that
which Valentin assumes.&nbsp; Of course, Mr. Stillman&rsquo;s
solution of the whole matter must not be regarded as an
absolutely scientific demonstration.&nbsp; It is simply an
induction in which a kind of artistic instinct, not communicable
or equally valuable to all people, has had the greatest part, but
to this mode of interpretation arch&aelig;ologists as a class
have been far too indifferent; and it is certain that in the
present case it has given us a theory which is most fruitful and
suggestive.</p>
<p>The little temple of Nik&egrave; Apteros has had, as Mr.
Stillman reminds us, a destiny unique of its kind.&nbsp; Like the
Parthenon, it was standing little more than two hundred years
ago, but during the Turkish occupation it was razed, and its
stones all built into the great bastion which covered the front
of the Acropolis and blocked up the staircase to the
Propyl&aelig;a.&nbsp; It was dug out and restored, nearly every
stone in its place, by two German architects during the reign of
Otho, and it stands again just as Pausanias described it on the
spot where old &AElig;geus watched for the return of Theseus from
Crete.&nbsp; In the distance are Salamis and &AElig;gina, and
beyond the purple hills lies Marathon.&nbsp; If the Melian statue
be indeed the Victory Without Wings, she had no unworthy
shrine.</p>
<p><!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>There are some other interesting essays in Mr.
Stillman&rsquo;s book on the wonderful topographical knowledge of
Ithaca displayed in the <i>Odyssey</i>, and discussions of this
kind are always interesting as long as there is no attempt to
represent Homer as the ordinary literary man; but the article on
the Melian statue is by far the most important and the most
delightful.&nbsp; Some people will, no doubt, regret the
possibility of the disappearance of the old name, and as Venus
not as Victory will still worship the stately goddess, but there
are others who will be glad to see in her the image and ideal of
that spiritual enthusiasm to which Athens owed her liberty, and
by which alone can liberty be won.</p>

<h2>M. CARO ON GEORGE SAND<br />
(<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, April 14, 1888.)</h2>
<p>The biography of a very great man from the pen of a very
ladylike writer&mdash;this is the best description we can give of
M. Caro&rsquo;s Life of George Sand.&nbsp; The late Professor of
the Sorbonne could chatter charmingly about culture, and had all
the fascinating insincerity of an accomplished phrase-maker;
being an extremely superior person he had a great contempt for
Democracy and its doings, but he was always popular with the
Duchesses of the Faubourg, as there was nothing in history or in
literature that he could not explain away for their edification;
having never done anything remarkable he was naturally elected a
member of the Academy, and he always remained loyal to the
traditions of <!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>that thoroughly respectable and
thoroughly pretentious institution.&nbsp; In fact, he was just
the sort of man who should never have attempted to write a Life
of George Sand or to interpret George Sand&rsquo;s genius.&nbsp;
He was too feminine to appreciate the grandeur of that large
womanly nature, too much of a <i>dilettante</i> to realize the
masculine force of that strong and ardent mind.&nbsp; He never
gets at the secret of George Sand, and never brings us near to
her wonderful personality.&nbsp; He looks on her simply as a
litt&eacute;rateur, as a writer of pretty stories of country life
and of charming, if somewhat exaggerated, romances.&nbsp; But
George Sand was much more than this.&nbsp; Beautiful as are such
books as <i>Consuelo</i> and <i>Mauprat</i>, <i>Fran&ccedil;ois
le Champi</i> and <i>La Mare au Diable</i>, yet in none of them
is she adequately expressed, by none of them is she adequately
revealed.&nbsp; As Mr. Matthew Arnold said, many years ago,
&lsquo;We do not know George Sand unless we feel the spirit which
goes through her work as a whole.&rsquo;&nbsp; With this spirit,
however, M. Caro has no sympathy.&nbsp; Madame Sand&rsquo;s
doctrines are antediluvian, he tells us, her philosophy is quite
dead and her ideas of social regeneration are Utopian, incoherent
and absurd.&nbsp; The best thing for us to do is to forget these
silly dreams and to read <i>Teverino</i> and <i>Le
Secr&eacute;taire Intime</i>.&nbsp; Poor M. Caro!&nbsp; This
spirit, which he treats with such airy flippancy, is the very
leaven of modern life.&nbsp; It is remoulding the world for us
and fashioning our age anew.&nbsp; If it is antediluvian, it is
so because the deluge is yet to come; if it is Utopian, then
Utopia must be added to our geographies.&nbsp; To what curious
straits M. Caro is driven by his violent prejudices may be
estimated by the fact that he tries to class George Sand&rsquo;s
novels with the old <!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span><i>Chansons de geste</i>, the
stories of adventure characteristic of primitive literatures;
whereas in using fiction as a vehicle of thought, and romance as
a means of influencing the social ideals of her age, George Sand
was merely carrying out the traditions of Voltaire and Rousseau,
of Diderot and of Chateaubriand.&nbsp; The novel, says M. Caro,
must be allied either to poetry or to science.&nbsp; That it has
found in philosophy one of its strongest allies seems not to have
occurred to him.&nbsp; In an English critic such a view might
possibly be excusable.&nbsp; Our greatest novelists, such as
Fielding, Scott and Thackeray, cared little for the philosophy of
their age.&nbsp; But coming, as it does, from a French critic,
the statement seems to show a strange want of recognition of one
of the most important elements of French fiction.&nbsp; Nor, even
in the narrow limits that he has imposed upon himself, can M.
Caro be said to be a very fortunate or felicitous critic.&nbsp;
To take merely one instance out of many, he says nothing of
George Sand&rsquo;s delightful treatment of art and the
artist&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; And yet how exquisitely does she
analyse each separate art and present it to us in its relation to
life!&nbsp; In <i>Consuelo</i> she tells us of music; in
<i>Horace</i> of authorship; in <i>Le Ch&acirc;teau des
D&eacute;sertes</i> of acting; in <i>Les Ma&icirc;tres
Mosa&iuml;stes</i> of mosaic work; in <i>Le Ch&acirc;teau de
Pictordu</i> of portrait painting; and in <i>La Daniella</i> of
the painting of landscape.&nbsp; What Mr. Ruskin and Mr. Browning
have done for England she did for France.&nbsp; She invented an
art literature.&nbsp; It is unnecessary, however, to discuss any
of M. Caro&rsquo;s minor failings, for the whole effect of the
book, so far as it attempts to portray for us the scope and
character of George Sand&rsquo;s genius, is entirely spoiled by
the false attitude assumed from the beginning, and though the
dictum may seem to <!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>many harsh and exclusive, we cannot
help feeling that an absolute incapacity for appreciating the
spirit of a great writer is no qualification for writing a
treatise on the subject.</p>
<p>As for Madame Sand&rsquo;s private life, which is so
intimately connected with her art (for, like Goethe, she had to
live her romances before she could write them), M. Caro says
hardly anything about it.&nbsp; He passes it over with a modesty
that almost makes one blush, and for fear of wounding the
susceptibilities of those <i>grandes dames</i> whose passions M.
Paul Bourget analyses with such subtlety, he transforms her
mother, who was a typical French <i>grisette</i>, into &lsquo;a
very amiable and <i>spirituelle</i> milliner&rsquo;!&nbsp; It
must be admitted that Joseph Surface himself could hardly show
greater tact and delicacy, though we ourselves must plead guilty
to preferring Madame Sand&rsquo;s own description of her as an
&lsquo;enfant du vieux pav&eacute; de Paris.&rsquo;</p>

<h2>A FASCINATING BOOK<br />
(<i>Woman&rsquo;s World</i>, November 1888.)</h2>
<p>Mr. Alan Cole&rsquo;s carefully-edited translation of M.
Lef&eacute;bure&rsquo;s history of <i>Embroidery and Lace</i> is
one of the most fascinating books that has appeared on this
delightful subject.&nbsp; M. Lef&eacute;bure is one of the
administrators of the Mus&eacute;e des Arts D&eacute;coratifs at
Paris, besides being a lace manufacturer; and his work has not
merely an important historical value, but as a handbook of
technical <!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>instruction it will be found of the
greatest service by all needle-women.&nbsp; Indeed, as the
translator himself points out, M. Lef&eacute;bure&rsquo;s book
suggests the question whether it is not rather by the needle and
the bobbin, than by the brush, the graver or the chisel, that the
influence of woman should assert itself in the arts.&nbsp; In
Europe, at any rate, woman is sovereign in the domain of
art-needlework, and few men would care to dispute with her the
right of using those delicate implements so intimately associated
with the dexterity of her nimble and slender fingers; nor is
there any reason why the productions of embroidery should not, as
Mr. Alan Cole suggests, be placed on the same level with those of
painting, engraving and sculpture, though there must always be a
great difference between those purely decorative arts that
glorify their own material and the more imaginative arts in which
the material is, as it were, annihilated, and absorbed into the
creation of a new form.&nbsp; In the beautifying of modern houses
it certainly must be admitted&mdash;indeed, it should be more
generally recognized than it is&mdash;that rich embroidery on
hangings and curtains, <i>porti&egrave;res</i>, couches and the
like, produces a far more decorative and far more artistic effect
than can be gained from our somewhat wearisome English practice
of covering the walls with pictures and engravings; and the
almost complete disappearance of embroidery from dress has robbed
modern costume of one of the chief elements of grace and
fancy.</p>
<p>That, however, a great improvement has taken place in English
embroidery during the last ten or fifteen years cannot, I think,
be denied.&nbsp; It is shown, not merely in the work of
individual artists, such as Mrs. Holiday, Miss May Morris and
others, but <!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>also in the admirable productions of
the South Kensington School of Embroidery (the best&mdash;indeed,
the only real good&mdash;school that South Kensington has
produced).&nbsp; It is pleasant to note on turning over the
leaves of M. Lef&eacute;bure&rsquo;s book, that in this we are
merely carrying out certain old traditions of Early English
art.&nbsp; In the seventh century, St. Ethelreda, first abbess of
the monastery of Ely, made an offering to St. Cuthbert of a
sacred ornament she had worked with gold and precious stones, and
the cope and maniple of St. Cuthbert, which are preserved at
Durham, are considered to be specimens of <i>opus
Anglicanum</i>.&nbsp; In the year 800, the Bishop of Durham
allotted the income of a farm of two hundred acres for life to an
embroideress named Eanswitha, in consideration of her keeping in
repair the vestments of the clergy in his diocese.&nbsp; The
battle standard of King Alfred was embroidered by Danish
Princesses; and the Anglo-Saxon Gudric gave Alcuid a piece of
land, on condition that she instructed his daughter in
needle-work.&nbsp; Queen Mathilda bequeathed to the Abbey of the
Holy Trinity at Caen a tunic embroidered at Winchester by the
wife of one Alderet; and when William presented himself to the
English nobles, after the Battle of Hastings, he wore a mantle
covered with Anglo-Saxon embroideries, which is probably, M.
Lef&eacute;bure suggests, the same as that mentioned in the
inventory of the Bayeux Cathedral, where, after the entry
relating to the <i>broderie &agrave; telle</i> (representing the
conquest of England), two mantles are described&mdash;one of King
William, &lsquo;all of gold, powdered with crosses and blossoms
of gold, and edged along the lower border with an orphrey of
figures.&rsquo;&nbsp; The most splendid example of the <i>opus
Anglicanum</i> now in existence is, of course, the Syon cope at
the South <!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>Kensington Museum; but English work
seems to have been celebrated all over the Continent.&nbsp; Pope
Innocent <span class="smcap">iv.</span> so admired the splendid
vestments worn by the English clergy in 1246, that he ordered
similar articles from Cistercian monasteries in England.&nbsp;
St. Dunstan, the artistic English monk, was known as a designer
for embroideries; and the stole of St. Thomas &agrave; Becket is
still preserved in the cathedral at Sens, and shows us the
interlaced scroll-forms used by Anglo-Saxon MS. illuminators.</p>
<p>How far this modern artistic revival of rich and delicate
embroidery will bear fruit depends, of course, almost entirely on
the energy and study that women are ready to devote to it; but I
think that it must be admitted that all our decorative arts in
Europe at present have, at least, this element of
strength&mdash;that they are in immediate relationship with the
decorative arts of Asia.&nbsp; Wherever we find in European
history a revival of decorative art, it has, I fancy, nearly
always been due to Oriental influence and contact with Oriental
nations.&nbsp; Our own keenly intellectual art has more than once
been ready to sacrifice real decorative beauty either to
imitative presentation or to ideal motive.&nbsp; It has taken
upon itself the burden of expression, and has sought to interpret
the secrets of thought and passion.&nbsp; In its marvellous truth
of presentation it has found its strength, and yet its weakness
is there also.&nbsp; It is never with impunity that an art seeks
to mirror life.&nbsp; If Truth has her revenge upon those who do
not follow her, she is often pitiless to her worshippers.&nbsp;
In Byzantium the two arts met&mdash;Greek art, with its
intellectual sense of form, and its quick sympathy with humanity;
Oriental art, with its gorgeous materialism, its frank rejection
of <!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>imitation, its wonderful secrets of craft and colour,
its splendid textures, its rare metals and jewels, its marvellous
and priceless traditions.&nbsp; They had, indeed, met before, but
in Byzantium they were married; and the sacred tree of the
Persians, the palm of Zoroaster, was embroidered on the hem of
the garments of the Western world.&nbsp; Even the Iconoclasts,
the Philistines of theological history, who, in one of those
strange outbursts of rage against Beauty that seem to occur only
amongst European nations, rose up against the wonder and
magnificence of the new art, served merely to distribute its
secrets more widely; and in the <i>Liber Pontificalis</i>,
written in 687 by Athanasius, the librarian, we read of an influx
into Rome of gorgeous embroideries, the work of men who had
arrived from Constantinople and from Greece.&nbsp; The triumph of
the Mussulman gave the decorative art of Europe a new
departure&mdash;that very principle of their religion that
forbade the actual representation of any object in nature being
of the greatest artistic service to them, though it was not, of
course, strictly carried out.&nbsp; The Saracens introduced into
Sicily the art of weaving silken and golden fabrics; and from
Sicily the manufacture of fine stuffs spread to the North of
Italy, and became localized in Genoa, Florence, Venice, and other
towns.&nbsp; A still greater art-movement took place in Spain
under the Moors and Saracens, who brought over workmen from
Persia to make beautiful things for them.&nbsp; M.
Lef&eacute;bure tells us of Persian embroidery penetrating as far
as Andalusia; and Almeria, like Palermo, had its H&ocirc;tel des
Tiraz, which rivalled the H&ocirc;tel des Tiraz at Bagdad,
<i>tiraz</i> being the generic name for ornamental tissues and
costumes made with them.&nbsp; Spangles (those pretty little
discs of gold, <!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 113</span>silver, or polished steel, used in
certain embroidery for dainty glinting effects) were a Saracenic
invention; and Arabic letters often took the place of letters in
the Roman characters for use in inscriptions upon embroidered
robes and Middle Age tapestries, their decorative value being so
much greater.&nbsp; The book of crafts by Etienne Boileau,
provost of the merchants in 1258&ndash;1268, contains a curious
enumeration of the different craft-guilds of Paris, among which
we find &lsquo;the tapiciers, or makers of the <i>tapis
sarrasinois</i> (or Saracen cloths), who say that their craft is
for the service only of churches, or great men like kings and
counts&rsquo;; and, indeed, even in our own day, nearly all our
words descriptive of decorative textures and decorative methods
point to an Oriental origin.&nbsp; What the inroads of the
Mohammedans did for Sicily and Spain, the return of the Crusaders
did for the other countries of Europe.&nbsp; The nobles who left
for Palestine clad in armour, came back in the rich stuffs of the
East; and their costumes, pouches (<i>aum&ocirc;ni&egrave;res
sarrasinoises</i>), and caparisons excited the admiration of the
needle-workers of the West.&nbsp; Matthew Paris says that at the
sacking of Antioch, in 1098, gold, silver and priceless costumes
were so equally distributed among the Crusaders, that many who
the night before were famishing and imploring relief, suddenly
found themselves overwhelmed with wealth; and Robert de Clair
tells us of the wonderful f&ecirc;tes that followed the capture
of Constantinople.&nbsp; The thirteenth century, as M.
Lef&eacute;bure points out, was conspicuous for an increased
demand in the West for embroidery.&nbsp; Many Crusaders made
offerings to churches of plunder from Palestine; and St. Louis,
on his return from the first Crusade, offered thanks at St. Denis
to God for mercies bestowed <!-- page 114--><a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>on him
during his six years&rsquo; absence and travel, and presented
some richly embroidered stuffs to be used on great occasions as
coverings to the reliquaries containing the relics of holy
martyrs.&nbsp; European embroidery, having thus become possessed
of new materials and wonderful methods, developed on its own
intellectual and imitative lines, inclining, as it went on, to
the purely pictorial, and seeking to rival painting, and to
produce landscapes and figure-subjects with elaborate perspective
and subtle aerial effects.&nbsp; A fresh Oriental influence,
however, came through the Dutch and the Portuguese, and the
famous <i>Compagnie des Grandes Indes</i>; and M. Lef&eacute;bure
gives an illustration of a door-hanging now in the Cluny Museum,
where we find the French <i>fleurs-de-lys</i> intermixed with
Indian ornament.&nbsp; The hangings of Madame de
Maintenon&rsquo;s room at Fontainebleau, which were embroidered
at St. Cyr, represent Chinese scenery upon a jonquil-yellow
ground.</p>
<p>Clothes were sent out ready cut to the East to be embroidered,
and many of the delightful coats of the period of Louis <span
class="smcap">xv.</span> and Louis <span
class="smcap">xvi.</span> owe their dainty decoration to the
needles of Chinese artists.&nbsp; In our own day the influence of
the East is strongly marked.&nbsp; Persia has sent us her carpets
for patterns, and Cashmere her lovely shawls, and India her
dainty muslins finely worked with gold thread palmates, and
stitched over with iridescent beetles&rsquo; wings.&nbsp; We are
beginning now to dye by Oriental methods, and the silk robes of
China and Japan have taught us new wonders of colour-combination,
and new subtleties of delicate design.&nbsp; Whether we have yet
learned to make a wise use of what we have acquired is less
certain.&nbsp; If books produce an effect, this book of M.
Lef&eacute;bure should certainly make us study with <!-- page
115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>still deeper interest the whole question of embroidery,
and by those who already work with their needles it will be found
full of most fertile suggestion and most admirable advice.</p>
<p>Even to read of the marvellous works of embroidery that were
fashioned in bygone ages is pleasant.&nbsp; Time has kept a few
fragments of Greek embroidery of the fourth century <span
class="smcap">b.c.</span> for us.&nbsp; One is figured in M.
Lef&eacute;bure&rsquo;s book&mdash;a chain-stitch embroidery of
yellow flax upon a mulberry-coloured worsted material, with
graceful spirals and palmetto-patterns: and another, a tapestried
cloth powdered with ducks, was reproduced in the <i>Woman&rsquo;s
World</i> some months ago for an article by Mr. Alan Cole. <a

of some dead Egyptian a piece of delicate work.&nbsp; In the
treasury at Ratisbon is preserved a specimen of Byzantine
embroidery on which the Emperor Constantine is depicted riding on
a white palfrey, and receiving homage from the East and
West.&nbsp; Metz has a red silk cope wrought with great eagles,
the gift of Charlemagne, and Bayeux the needle-wrought epic of
Queen Matilda.&nbsp; But where is the great crocus-coloured robe,
wrought for Athena, on which the gods fought against the
giants?&nbsp; Where is the huge velarium that Nero stretched
across the Colosseum at Rome, on which was represented the starry
sky, and Apollo driving a chariot drawn by steeds?&nbsp; How one

Chilperic, with its three hundred golden bees; or the fantastic
robes that excited the indignation of the Bishop of Pontus, and
were embroidered with &lsquo;lions, panthers, <!-- page 116--><a

days, formed with four pearls. <a name="citation116"></a><a

pyramidal group, consisting of a series of six ranks of
performers, with beautiful instruments wrought in raised
needle-work.&nbsp; &lsquo;Into the night go one and all,&rsquo;
as Mr. Henley sings in his charming <i>Ballade of Dead
Actors</i>.</p>
<p>Many of the facts related by M. Lef&eacute;bure about the
embroiderers&rsquo; guilds are also extremely interesting.&nbsp;
Etienne Boileau, in his book of crafts, to which I have already
alluded, tells us that a member of the guild was prohibited from
using gold of less value than &lsquo;eight sous (about 6s.) the
skein; he was bound to use the best silk, and never to mix thread
with silk, because that made the work false and bad.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The test or trial piece prescribed for a worker who was the son
of a master-embroiderer was &lsquo;a single figure, a sixth of
the natural size, to be shaded in gold&rsquo;; whilst one not the
son of a master was required to produce &lsquo;a complete
incident with many figures.&rsquo;&nbsp; The book of crafts also
mentions &lsquo;cutters-out and stencillers and
illuminators&rsquo; amongst those employed in the industry of
embroidery.&nbsp; In 1551 the Parisian Corporation of
Embroiderers issued a notice that &lsquo;for the future, the
colouring in representations of nude figures and faces should be
done in three or four gradations of carnation-dyed silk, and not,
as formerly, in white silks.&rsquo;&nbsp; During the fifteenth
century every household of any position retained the services of
an embroiderer by the year.&nbsp; The preparation of colours
also, whether for painting or for dyeing threads and textile
fabrics, was a matter which, M. Lef&eacute;bure points out,
received close attention from the artists of the Middle
Ages.&nbsp; Many undertook long journeys to obtain the more
famous recipes, which they filed, subsequently adding to and
correcting them as experience dictated.&nbsp; <!-- page 118--><a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>Nor were
great artists above making and supplying designs for
embroidery.&nbsp; Raphael made designs for Francis <span
class="smcap">i.</span>, and Boucher for Louis <span
class="smcap">xv.</span>; and in the Ambras collection at Vienna
is a superb set of sacerdotal robes from designs by the brothers
Van Eyck and their pupils.&nbsp; Early in the sixteenth century
books of embroidery designs were produced, and their success was
so great that in a few years French, German, Italian, Flemish,
and English publishers spread broadcast books of design made by
their best engravers.&nbsp; In the same century, in order to give
the designers opportunity of studying directly from nature, Jean
Robin opened a garden with conservatories, in which he cultivated
strange varieties of plants then but little known in our
latitudes.&nbsp; The rich brocades and brocadelles of the time
are characterized by the introduction of large flowery patterns,
with pomegranates and other fruits with fine foliage.</p>
<p>The second part of M. Lef&eacute;bure&rsquo;s book is devoted
to the history of lace, and though some may not find it quite as
interesting as the earlier portion it will more than repay
perusal; and those who still work in this delicate and fanciful
art will find many valuable suggestions in it, as well as a large
number of exceedingly beautiful designs.&nbsp; Compared to
embroidery, lace seems comparatively modern.&nbsp; M.
Lef&eacute;bure and Mr. Alan Cole tell us that there is no
reliable or documentary evidence to prove the existence of lace
before the fifteenth century.&nbsp; Of course in the East, light
tissues, such as gauzes, muslins, and nets, were made at very
early times, and were used as veils and scarfs after the manner
of subsequent laces, and women enriched them with some sort of
embroidery, or varied the openness of them by here and there
drawing out threads.&nbsp; The threads of fringes seem also to
have been plaited <!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>and knotted together, and the
borders of one of the many fashions of Roman toga were of open
reticulated weaving.&nbsp; The Egyptian Museum at the Louvre has
a curious network embellished with glass beads; and the monk
Reginald, who took part in opening the tomb of St. Cuthbert at
Durham in the twelfth century, writes that the Saint&rsquo;s
shroud had a fringe of linen threads an inch long, surmounted by
a border, &lsquo;worked upon the threads,&rsquo; with
representations of birds and pairs of beasts, there being between
each such pair a branching tree, a survival of the palm of
Zoroaster, to which I have before alluded.&nbsp; Our authors,
however, do not in these examples recognize lace, the production
of which involves more refined and artistic methods, and
postulates a combination of skill and varied execution carried to
a higher degree of perfection.&nbsp; Lace, as we know it, seems
to have had its origin in the habit of embroidering linen.&nbsp;
White embroidery on linen has, M. Lef&eacute;bure remarks, a cold
and monotonous aspect; that with coloured threads is brighter and
gayer in effect, but is apt to fade in frequent washing; but
white embroidery relieved by open spaces in, or shapes cut from,
the linen ground, is possessed of an entirely new charm; and from
a sense of this the birth may be traced of an art in the result
of which happy contrasts are effected between ornamental details
of close texture and others of open-work.</p>
<p>Soon, also, was suggested the idea that, instead of
laboriously withdrawing threads from stout linen, it would be
more convenient to introduce a needle-made pattern into an open
network ground, which was called a <i>lacis</i>.&nbsp; Of this
kind of embroidery many specimens are extant.&nbsp; The Cluny
Museum possesses a linen cap said to have belonged to Charles
<span class="smcap">v.</span>; and <!-- page 120--><a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>an alb of
linen drawn-thread work, supposed to have been made by Anne of
Bohemia (1527), is preserved in the cathedral at Prague.&nbsp;
Catherine de Medicis had a bed draped with squares of
<i>r&eacute;seuil</i>, or <i>lacis</i>, and it is recorded that
&lsquo;the girls and servants of her household consumed much time
in making squares of <i>r&eacute;seuil</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
interesting pattern-books for open-ground embroidery, of which
the first was published in 1527 by Pierre Quinty, of Cologne,
supply us with the means of tracing the stages in the transition
from white thread embroidery to needle-point lace.&nbsp; We meet
in them with a style of needle-work which differs from embroidery
in not being wrought upon a stuff foundation.&nbsp; It is, in
fact, true lace, done, as it were, &lsquo;in the air,&rsquo; both
ground and pattern being entirely produced by the lace-maker.</p>
<p>The elaborate use of lace in costume was, of course, largely
stimulated by the fashion of wearing ruffs, and their companion
cuffs or sleeves.&nbsp; Catherine de Medicis induced one Frederic
Vinciolo to come from Italy and make ruffs and gadrooned collars,
the fashion of which she started in France; and Henry <span
class="smcap">iii.</span> was so punctilious over his ruffs that
he would iron and goffer his cuffs and collars himself rather
than see their pleats limp and out of shape.&nbsp; The
pattern-books also gave a great impulse to the art.&nbsp; M.
Lef&eacute;bure mentions German books with patterns of eagles,
heraldic emblems, hunting scenes, and plants and leaves belonging
to Northern vegetation; and Italian books, in which the
<i>motifs</i> consist of oleander blossoms, and elegant wreaths
and scrolls, landscapes with mythological scenes, and hunting
episodes, less realistic than the Northern ones, in which appear
fauns, and nymphs or <i>amorini</i> shooting arrows.&nbsp; With
regard to these patterns, <!-- page 121--><a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>M.
Lef&eacute;bure notices a curious fact.&nbsp; The oldest painting
in which lace is depicted is that of a lady, by Carpaccio, who
died about 1523.&nbsp; The cuffs of the lady are edged with a
narrow lace, the pattern of which reappears in Vecellio&rsquo;s
<i>Corona</i>, a book not published until 1591.&nbsp; This
particular pattern was, therefore, in use at least eighty years
before it got into circulation with other published patterns.</p>
<p>It was not, however, till the seventeenth century that lace
acquired a really independent character and individuality, and M.
Duplessis states that the production of the more noteworthy of
early laces owes more to the influence of men than to that of
women.&nbsp; The reign of Louis <span class="smcap">xiv.</span>
witnessed the production of the most stately needle-point laces,
the transformation of Venetian point, and the growth of <i>Points
d&rsquo;Alen&ccedil;on</i>, <i>d&rsquo;Argentan</i>, <i>de
Bruxelles</i> and <i>d&rsquo;Angleterre</i>.</p>
<p>The king, aided by Colbert, determined to make France the
centre, if possible, for lace manufacture, sending for this
purpose both to Venice and to Flanders for workers.&nbsp; The
studio of the Gobelins supplied designs.&nbsp; The dandies had
their huge rabatos or bands falling from beneath the chin over
the breast, and great prelates, like Bossuet and F&eacute;nelon,
wore their wonderful albs and rochets.&nbsp; It is related of a
collar made at Venice for Louis <span class="smcap">xiv.</span>
that the lace-workers, being unable to find sufficiently fine
horse-hair, employed some of their own hairs instead, in order to
secure that marvellous delicacy of work which they aimed at
producing.</p>
<p>In the eighteenth century, Venice, finding that laces of
lighter texture were sought after, set herself to make
rose-point; and at the Court of Louis <span
class="smcap">xv.</span> the choice of lace was regulated by
still more elaborate etiquette.&nbsp; The Revolution, however,
<!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>ruined many of the manufactures.&nbsp; Alen&ccedil;on
survived, and Napoleon encouraged it, and endeavoured to renew
the old rules about the necessity of wearing point-lace at Court
receptions.&nbsp; A wonderful piece of lace, powdered over with
devices of bees, and costing 40,000 francs, was ordered.&nbsp; It
was begun for the Empress Josephine, but in the course of its
making her escutcheons were replaced by those of Marie
Louise.</p>
<p>M. Lef&eacute;bure concludes his interesting history by
stating very clearly his attitude towards machine-made
lace.&nbsp; &lsquo;It would be an obvious loss to art,&rsquo; he
says, &lsquo;should the making of lace by hand become extinct,
for machinery, as skilfully devised as possible, cannot do what
the hand does.&rsquo;&nbsp; It can give us &lsquo;the results of
processes, not the creations of artistic handicraft.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Art is absent &lsquo;where formal calculation pretends to
supersede emotion&rsquo;; it is absent &lsquo;where no trace can
be detected of intelligence guiding handicraft, whose hesitancies
even possess peculiar charm . . . cheapness is never commendable
in respect of things which are not absolute necessities; it
lowers artistic standard.&rsquo;&nbsp; These are admirable
remarks, and with them we take leave of this fascinating book,
with its delightful illustrations, its charming anecdotes, its
excellent advice.&nbsp; Mr. Alan Cole deserves the thanks of all
who are interested in art for bringing this book before the
public in so attractive and so inexpensive a form.</p>

class="pagenum">p. 123</span>HENLEY&rsquo;S POEMS<br />
(<i>Woman&rsquo;s World</i>, December 1888.)</h2>
<p>&lsquo;If I were king,&rsquo; says Mr. Henley, in one of his
most modest rondeaus,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Art should aspire, yet ugliness be dear;<br
/>
Beauty, the shaft, should speed with wit for feather;<br />
And love, sweet love, should never fall to sere,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I were
king.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And these lines contain, if not the best criticism of his own
work, certainly a very complete statement of his aim and motive
as a poet.&nbsp; His little <i>Book of Verses</i> reveals to us
an artist who is seeking to find new methods of expression and
has not merely a delicate sense of beauty and a brilliant,
fantastic wit, but a real passion also for what is horrible,
ugly, or grotesque.&nbsp; No doubt, everything that is worthy of
existence is worthy also of art&mdash;at least, one would like to
think so&mdash;but while echo or mirror can repeat for us a
beautiful thing, to render artistically a thing that is ugly
requires the most exquisite alchemy of form, the most subtle
magic of transformation.&nbsp; To me there is more of the cry of
Marsyas than of the singing of Apollo in the earlier poems of Mr.
Henley&rsquo;s volume, <i>In Hospital</i>: <i>Rhymes and
Rhythms</i>, as he calls them.&nbsp; But it is impossible to deny
their power.&nbsp; Some of them are like bright, vivid pastels;
others like charcoal drawings, with dull blacks and murky whites;
others like etchings with deeply-bitten lines, and abrupt
contrasts, and clever colour-suggestions.&nbsp; In fact, they are
like anything and everything, except perfected poems&mdash;that
they certainly are not.&nbsp; They are still in the
twilight.&nbsp; <!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>They are preludes, experiments,
inspired jottings in a note-book, and should be heralded by a
design of &lsquo;Genius Making Sketches.&rsquo;&nbsp; Rhyme gives
architecture as well as melody to verse; it gives that delightful
sense of limitation which in all the arts is so pleasurable, and
is, indeed, one of the secrets of perfection; it will whisper, as
a French critic has said, &lsquo;things unexpected and charming,
things with strange and remote relations to each other,&rsquo;
and bind them together in indissoluble bonds of beauty; and in
his constant rejection of rhyme, Mr. Henley seems to me to have
abdicated half his power.&nbsp; He is a <i>roi en exil</i> who
has thrown away some of the strings of his lute; a poet who has
forgotten the fairest part of his kingdom.</p>
<p>However, all work criticizes itself.&nbsp; Here is one of Mr.
Henley&rsquo;s inspired jottings.&nbsp; According to the
temperament of the reader, it will serve either as a model or as
the reverse:</p>
<blockquote><p>As with varnish red and glistening<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dripped his hair; his feet were rigid;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Raised, he settled stiffly sideways:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You could see the hurts were spinal.</p>
<p>He had fallen from an engine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And been dragged along the metals.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It was hopeless, and they knew it;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So they covered him, and left him.</p>
<p>As he lay, by fits half sentient,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Inarticulately moaning,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With his stockinged feet protruded<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sharp and awkward from the blankets,</p>
<p>To his bed there came a woman,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stood and looked and sighed a little,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And departed without speaking,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As himself a few hours after.</p>
<p>I was told she was his sweetheart.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They were on the eve of marriage.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She was quiet as a statue,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But her lip was gray and writhen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>In this poem, the rhythm and the music, such as it is,
are obvious&mdash;perhaps a little too obvious.&nbsp; In the
following I see nothing but ingeniously printed prose.&nbsp; It
is a description&mdash;and a very accurate one&mdash;of a scene
in a hospital ward.&nbsp; The medical students are supposed to be
crowding round the doctor.&nbsp; What I quote is only a fragment,
but the poem itself is a fragment:</p>
<blockquote><p>So shows the ring<br />
Seen, from behind, round a conjuror<br />
Doing his pitch in the street.<br />
High shoulders, low shoulders, broad shoulders, narrow ones,<br
/>
Round, square, and angular, serry and shove;<br />
While from within a voice,<br />
Gravely and weightily fluent,<br />
Sounds; and then ceases; and suddenly<br />
(Look at the stress of the shoulders!)<br />
Out of a quiver of silence,<br />
Over the hiss of the spray,<br />
Comes a low cry, and the sound<br />
Of breath quick intaken through teeth<br />
Clenched in resolve.&nbsp; And the master<br />
Breaks from the crowd, and goes,<br />
Wiping his hands,<br />
To the next bed, with his pupils<br />
Flocking and whispering behind him.</p>
<p>Now one can see.<br />
Case Number One<br />
Sits (rather pale) with his bedclothes<br />
Stripped up, and showing his foot<br />
(Alas, for God&rsquo;s image!)<br />
Swaddled in wet white lint<br />
Brilliantly hideous with red.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Th&eacute;ophile Gautier once said that Flaubert&rsquo;s style
was meant to be read, and his own style to be looked at.&nbsp;
Mr. Henley&rsquo;s unrhymed rhythms form very dainty designs,
from a typographical point of view.&nbsp; From the point of view
of literature, they are a series of vivid, concentrated
impressions, with a keen grip of fact, a terrible actuality, and
an <!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>almost masterly power of picturesque
presentation.&nbsp; But the poetic form&mdash;what of that?</p>
<p>Well, let us pass to the later poems, to the rondels and
rondeaus, the sonnets and quatorzains, the echoes and the
ballades.&nbsp; How brilliant and fanciful this is!&nbsp; The
Toyokuni colour-print that suggested it could not be more
delightful.&nbsp; It seems to have kept all the wilful fantastic
charm of the original:</p>
<blockquote><p>Was I a Samurai renowned,<br />
Two-sworded, fierce, immense of bow?<br />
A histrion angular and profound?<br />
A priest? a porter?&mdash;Child, although<br />
I have forgotten clean, I know<br />
That in the shade of Fujisan,<br />
What time the cherry-orchards blow,<br />
I loved you once in old Japan.</p>
<p>As here you loiter, flowing-gowned<br />
And hugely sashed, with pins a-row<br />
Your quaint head as with flamelets crowned,<br />
Demure, inviting&mdash;even so,<br />
When merry maids in Miyako<br />
To feel the sweet o&rsquo; the year began,<br />
And green gardens to overflow,<br />
I loved you once in old Japan.</p>
<p>Clear shine the hills; the rice-fields round<br />
Two cranes are circling; sleepy and slow,<br />
A blue canal the lake&rsquo;s blue bound<br />
Breaks at the bamboo bridge; and lo!<br />
Touched with the sundown&rsquo;s spirit and glow,<br />
I see you turn, with flirted fan,<br />
Against the plum-tree&rsquo;s bloomy snow . . .<br />
I loved you once in old Japan!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Envoy</span>.</p>
<p>Dear, &rsquo;twas a dozen lives ago<br />
But that I was a lucky man<br />
The Toyokuni here will show:<br />
I loved you&mdash;once&mdash;in old Japan!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>This rondel, too&mdash;how light it is, and
graceful!&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>We&rsquo;ll to the woods and gather may<br />
Fresh from the footprints of the rain.<br />
We&rsquo;ll to the woods, at every vein<br />
To drink the spirit of the day.</p>
<p>The winds of spring are out at play,<br />
The needs of spring in heart and brain.<br />
We&rsquo;ll to the woods and gather may<br />
Fresh from the footprints of the rain.</p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s too near her end, you say?<br />
Hark to the blackbird&rsquo;s mad refrain!<br />
It waits for her, the vast Inane?<br />
Then, girls, to help her on the way<br />
We&rsquo;ll to the woods and gather may.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are fine verses, also, scattered through this little
book; some of them very strong, as&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Out of the night that covers me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Black as the pit from pole to pole,<br />
I thank whatever gods may be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For my unconquerable soul.</p>
<p>It matters not how strait the gate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How charged with punishments the scroll,<br />
I am the master of my fate:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I am the captain of my soul.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Others with a true touch of romance, as&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Or ever the knightly years were gone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With the old world to the grave,<br />
I was a king in Babylon,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And you were a Christian slave.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here and there we come across such felicitous phrases
as&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the sand<br />
The gold prow-griffin claws a hold,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
spires<br />
Shine and are changed,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and many other graceful or fanciful lines, even &lsquo;the
<!-- page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>green sky&rsquo;s minor thirds&rsquo; being perfectly
right in its place, and a very refreshing bit of affectation in a
volume where there is so much that is natural.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Henley is not to be judged by samples.&nbsp;
Indeed, the most attractive thing in the book is no single poem
that is in it, but the strong humane personality that stands
behind both flawless and faulty work alike, and looks out through
many masks, some of them beautiful, and some grotesque, and not a
few misshapen.&nbsp; In the case with most of our modern poets,
when we have analysed them down to an adjective, we can go no
further, or we care to go no further; but with this book it is
different.&nbsp; Through these reeds and pipes blows the very
breath of life.&nbsp; It seems as if one could put one&rsquo;s
hand upon the singer&rsquo;s heart and count its
pulsations.&nbsp; There is something wholesome, virile and sane
about the man&rsquo;s soul.&nbsp; Anybody can be reasonable, but
to be sane is not common; and sane poets are as rare as blue
lilies, though they may not be quite so delightful.</p>
<blockquote><p>Let the great winds their worst and wildest
blow,<br />
Or the gold weather round us mellow slow;<br />
We have fulfilled ourselves, and we can dare,<br />
And we can conquer, though we may not share<br />
In the rich quiet of the afterglow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is to
come,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is the concluding stanza of the last rondeau&mdash;indeed, of
the last poem in the collection, and the high, serene temper
displayed in these lines serves at once as keynote and keystone
to the book.&nbsp; The very lightness and slightness of so much
of the work, its careless moods and casual fancies, seem to
suggest a nature that is not primarily interested in art&mdash;a
nature, like Sordello&rsquo;s, passionately enamoured of life,
one to which lyre and lute are <!-- page 129--><a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>things of
less importance.&nbsp; From this mere joy of living, this frank
delight in experience for its own sake, this lofty indifference,
and momentary unregretted ardours, come all the faults and all
the beauties of the volume.&nbsp; But there is this difference
between them&mdash;the faults are deliberate, and the result of
much study; the beauties have the air of fascinating
impromptus.&nbsp; Mr. Henley&rsquo;s healthy, if sometimes
misapplied, confidence in the myriad suggestions of life gives
him his charm.&nbsp; He is made to sing along the highways, not
to sit down and write.&nbsp; If he took himself more seriously,
his work would become trivial.</p>
<p class="gutcpm"><i>A Book of Verses</i>.&nbsp; By William
Ernest Henley.&nbsp; (David Nutt.)</p>
<h2>SOME LITERARY LADIES<br />
(<i>Woman&rsquo;s World</i>, January 1889.)</h2>
<p>In a recent article on <i>English Poetesses</i>, I ventured to
suggest that our women of letters should turn their attention
somewhat more to prose and somewhat less to poetry.&nbsp; Women
seem to me to possess just what our literature wants&mdash;a
light touch, a delicate hand, a graceful mode of treatment, and
an unstudied felicity of phrase.&nbsp; We want some one who will
do for our prose what Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute; did for the
prose of France.&nbsp; George Eliot&rsquo;s style was far too
cumbrous, and Charlotte Bront&euml;&rsquo;s too
exaggerated.&nbsp; However, one must not forget that amongst the
women of England there have been some charming letter-writers,
and certainly no book can be more delightful reading than Mrs.
Ross&rsquo;s <i>Three Generations of English Women</i>, which has
recently appeared.&nbsp; The <!-- page 130--><a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>three
Englishwomen whose memoirs and correspondence Mrs. Ross has so
admirably edited are Mrs. John Taylor, Mrs. Sarah Austin, and
Lady Duff Gordon, all of them remarkable personalities, and two
of them women of brilliant wit and European reputation.&nbsp;
Mrs. Taylor belonged to that great Norwich family about whom the
Duke of Sussex remarked that they reversed the ordinary saying
that it takes nine tailors to make a man, and was for many years
one of the most distinguished figures in the famous society of
her native town.&nbsp; Her only daughter married John Austin, the
great authority on jurisprudence, and her <i>salon</i> in Paris
was the centre of the intellect and culture of her day.&nbsp;
Lucie Duff Gordon, the only child of John and Sarah Austin,
inherited the talents of her parents.&nbsp; A beauty, a <i>femme
d&rsquo;esprit</i>, a traveller, and clever writer, she charmed
and fascinated her age, and her premature death in Egypt was
really a loss to our literature.&nbsp; It is to her daughter that
we owe this delightful volume of memoirs.</p>
<p>First we are introduced to Mrs. Ross&rsquo;s
great-grandmother, Mrs. Taylor, who &lsquo;was called, by her
intimate friends, &ldquo;Madame Roland of Norwich,&rdquo; from
her likeness to the portraits of the handsome and unfortunate
Frenchwoman.&rsquo;&nbsp; We hear of her darning her boy&rsquo;s
grey worsted stockings while holding her own with Southey and
Brougham, and dancing round the Tree of Liberty with Dr. Parr
when the news of the fall of the Bastille was first known.&nbsp;
Amongst her friends were Sir James Mackintosh, the most popular
man of the day, &lsquo;to whom Madame de Sta&euml;l wrote,
&ldquo;Il n&rsquo;y a pas de soci&eacute;t&eacute; sans
vous.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;C&rsquo;est tr&egrave;s ennuyeux de
d&icirc;ner sans vous; la soci&eacute;t&eacute; ne va pas quand
vous n&rsquo;&ecirc;tes pas l&agrave;&rdquo;;&rsquo; Sir James
Smith, the botanist; Crabb <!-- page 131--><a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>Robinson;
the Gurneys; Mrs. Barbauld; Dr. Alderson and his charming
daughter, Amelia Opie; and many other well-known people.&nbsp;
Her letters are extremely sensible and thoughtful.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Nothing at present,&rsquo; she says in one of them,
&lsquo;suits my taste so well as Susan&rsquo;s Latin lessons, and
her philosophical old master. . . . When we get to Cicero&rsquo;s
discussions on the nature of the soul, or Virgil&rsquo;s fine
descriptions, my mind is filled up.&nbsp; Life is either a dull
round of eating, drinking, and sleeping, or a spark of ethereal
fire just kindled. . . . The character of girls must depend upon
their reading as much as upon the company they keep.&nbsp;
Besides the intrinsic pleasure to be derived from solid
knowledge, a woman ought to consider it as her best resource
against poverty.&rsquo;&nbsp; This is a somewhat caustic
aphorism: &lsquo;A romantic woman is a troublesome friend, as she
expects you to be as impudent as herself, and is mortified at
what she calls coldness and insensibility.&rsquo;&nbsp; And this
is admirable: &lsquo;The art of life is not to estrange oneself
from society, and yet not to pay too dear for it.&rsquo;&nbsp;
This, too, is good: &lsquo;Vanity, like curiosity, is wanted as a
stimulus to exertion; indolence would certainly get the better of
us if it were not for these two powerful principles&rsquo;; and
there is a keen touch of humour in the following: &lsquo;Nothing
is so gratifying as the idea that virtue and philanthropy are
becoming fashionable.&rsquo;&nbsp; Dr. James Martineau, in a
letter to Mrs. Ross, gives us a pleasant picture of the old lady
returning from market &lsquo;weighted by her huge basket, with
the shank of a leg of mutton thrust out to betray its
contents,&rsquo; and talking divinely about philosophy, poets,
politics, and every intellectual topic of the day.&nbsp; She was
a woman of admirable good sense, a type of Roman matron, <!--
page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>and quite as careful as were the Roman matrons to keep
up the purity of her native tongue.</p>
<p>Mrs. Taylor, however, was more or less limited to
Norwich.&nbsp; Mrs. Austin was for the world.&nbsp; In London,
Paris, and Germany, she ruled and dominated society, loved by
every one who knew her.&nbsp; &lsquo;She is &ldquo;My best and
brightest&rdquo; to Lord Jeffrey; &ldquo;Dear, fair and
wise&rdquo; to Sydney Smith; &ldquo;My great ally&rdquo; to Sir
James Stephen; &ldquo;Sunlight through waste weltering
chaos&rdquo; to Thomas Carlyle (while he needed her aid);
&ldquo;La petite m&egrave;re du genre humain&rdquo; to Michael
Chevalier; &ldquo;Liebes M&uuml;tterlein&rdquo; to John Stuart
Mill; and &ldquo;My own Professorin&rdquo; to Charles Buller, to
whom she taught German, as well as to the sons of Mr. James
Mill.&rsquo;&nbsp; Jeremy Bentham, when on his deathbed, gave her
a ring with his portrait and some of his hair let in
behind.&nbsp; &lsquo;There, my dear,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;it is
the only ring I ever gave a woman.&rsquo;&nbsp; She corresponded
with Guizot, Barthelemy de St. Hilaire, the Grotes, Dr. Whewell,
the Master of Trinity, Nassau Senior, the Duchesse
d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans, Victor Cousin, and many other
distinguished people.&nbsp; Her translation of Ranke&rsquo;s
<i>History of the Popes</i> is admirable; indeed, all her
literary work was thoroughly well done, and her edition of her
husband&rsquo;s <i>Province of Jurisprudence</i> deserves the
very highest praise.&nbsp; Two people more unlike than herself
and her husband it would have been difficult to find.&nbsp; He
was habitually grave and despondent; she was brilliantly
handsome, fond of society, in which she shone, and &lsquo;with an
almost superabundance of energy and animal spirits,&rsquo; Mrs.
Ross tells us.&nbsp; She married him because she thought him
perfect, but he never produced the work of which he was worthy,
and of which she knew him to be worthy.&nbsp; Her estimate of him
in <!-- page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>the preface to the <i>Jurisprudence</i> is wonderfully
striking and simple.&nbsp; &lsquo;He was never sanguine.&nbsp; He
was intolerant of any imperfection.&nbsp; He was always under the
control of severe love of truth.&nbsp; He lived and died a poor
man.&rsquo;&nbsp; She was terribly disappointed in him, but she
loved him.&nbsp; Some years after his death, she wrote to M.
Guizot:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the intervals of my study of his works I read
his letters to me&mdash;<i>forty-five years of love-letters</i>,
the last as tender and passionate as the first.&nbsp; And how
full of noble sentiments!&nbsp; The midday of our lives was
clouded and stormy, full of cares and disappointments; but the
sunset was bright and serene&mdash;as bright as the morning, and
<i>more</i> serene.&nbsp; Now it is night with me, and must
remain so till the dawn of another day.&nbsp; I am always
alone&mdash;that is, <i>I live with him</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most interesting letters in the book are certainly those
to M. Guizot, with whom she maintained the closest intellectual
friendship; but there is hardly one of them that does not contain
something clever, or thoughtful, or witty, while those addressed
to her, in turn, are very interesting.&nbsp; Carlyle writes her
letters full of lamentations, the wail of a Titan in pain,
superbly exaggerated for literary effect.</p>
<blockquote><p>Literature, one&rsquo;s sole craft and staff of
life, lies broken in abeyance; what room for music amid the
braying of innumerable jackasses, the howling of innumerable
hy&aelig;nas whetting the tooth to eat them up?&nbsp; Alas for
it! it is a sick disjointed time; neither shall we ever mend it;
at best let us hope to mend ourselves.&nbsp; I declare I
sometimes think of throwing down the Pen altogether as a
worthless weapon; and leading out a colony of these poor starving
Drudges to the waste places of their old Mother Earth, when for
sweat of their brow bread <i>will</i> rise for them; it were
perhaps the worthiest service that at this moment could be
rendered our old world to throw open <!-- page 134--><a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>for it the
doors of the New.&nbsp; Thither must they come at last,
&lsquo;bursts of eloquence&rsquo; will do nothing; men are
starving and will try many things before they die.&nbsp; But poor
I, <i>ach Gott</i>!&nbsp; I am no Hengist or Alaric; only a
writer of Articles in bad prose; stick to thy last, O Tutor; the
Pen is not worthless, it is omnipotent to those who have
Faith.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Henri Beyle (Stendhal), the great, I am often tempted to think
the greatest of French novelists, writes her a charming letter
about <i>nuances</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;It seems to me,&rsquo; he
says, &lsquo;that except when they read Shakespeare, Byron, or
Sterne, no Englishman understands &ldquo;<i>nuances</i>&rdquo;;
we adore them.&nbsp; A fool says to a woman &ldquo;I love
you&rdquo;; the words mean nothing, he might as well say
&ldquo;Olli Batachor&rdquo;; it is the <i>nuance</i> which gives
force to the meaning.&rsquo;&nbsp; In 1839 Mrs. Austin writes to
Victor Cousin: &lsquo;I have seen young Gladstone, a
distinguished Tory who wants to re-establish education based on
the Church in quite a Catholic form&rsquo;; and we find her
corresponding with Mr. Gladstone on the subject of
education.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you are strong enough to provide
motives and checks,&rsquo; she says to him, &lsquo;you may do two
blessed acts&mdash;reform your clergy and teach your
people.&nbsp; As it is, how few of them conceive what it is to
teach a people&rsquo;!&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone replies at great
length, and in many letters, from which we may quote this
passage:</p>
<blockquote><p>You are for pressing and urging the people to
their profit against their inclination: so am I.&nbsp; You set
little value upon all merely technical instruction, upon all that
fails to touch the inner nature of man: so do I.&nbsp; And here I
find ground of union broad and deep-laid. . . .</p>
<p>I more than doubt whether your idea, namely that of raising
man to social sufficiency and morality, can be accomplished,
except through the ancient religion of Christ; . . . or whether,
the principles of eclecticism are <!-- page 135--><a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>legitimately applicable to the Gospel; or whether, if
we find ourselves in a state of incapacity to work through the
Church, we can remedy the defect by the adoption of principles
contrary to hers. . . .</p>
<p>But indeed I am most unfit to pursue the subject; private
circumstances of no common interest are upon me, as I have become
very recently engaged to Miss Glynne, and I hope your
recollections will enable you in some degree to excuse me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lord Jeffrey has a very curious and suggestive letter on
popular education, in which he denies, or at least doubts, the
effect of this education on morals.&nbsp; He, however, supports
it on the ground &lsquo;that it will increase the enjoyment of
individuals,&rsquo; which is certainly a very sensible
claim.&nbsp; Humboldt writes to her about an old Indian language
which was preserved by a parrot, the tribe who spoke it having
been exterminated, and about &lsquo;young Darwin,&rsquo; who had
just published his first book.&nbsp; Here are some extracts from
her own letters:</p>
<blockquote><p>I heard from Lord Lansdowne two or three days ago.
. . . I think he is <i>ce que nous avons de mieux</i>.&nbsp; He
wants only the energy that great ambition gives.&nbsp; He says,
&lsquo;We shall have a parliament of railway kings&rsquo; . . .
what can be worse than that?&mdash;The deification of money by a
whole people.&nbsp; As Lord Brougham says, we have no right to
give ourselves pharisaical airs.&nbsp; I must give you a story
sent to me.&nbsp; Mrs. Hudson, the railway queen, was shown a
bust of Marcus Aurelius at Lord Westminster&rsquo;s, on which she
said, &lsquo;I suppose that is not the present
Marquis.&rsquo;&nbsp; To <i>go&ucirc;ter</i> this, you must know
that the extreme vulgar (hackney coachmen, etc.) in England
pronounce &lsquo;marquis&rsquo; very like
&lsquo;Marcus.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Dec.</i> 17<i>th</i>.&mdash;Went to Savigny&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Nobody was there but W. Grimm and his wife and a few men.&nbsp;
Grimm told me he had received two volumes of Norwegian
fairy-tales, and that they were delightful.&nbsp; Talking of
them, I said, &lsquo;Your children appear to be the happiest in
the <!-- page 136--><a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>world; they live in the midst of
fairy-tales.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I
must tell you about that.&nbsp; When we were at G&ouml;ttingen,
somebody spoke to my little son about his father&rsquo;s
<i>M&auml;hrchen</i>.&nbsp; He had read them but never thought of
their being mine.&nbsp; He came running to me, and said with an
offended air, &ldquo;Father, they say you wrote those
fairy-tales; surely you never invented such silly
rubbish?&rdquo;&nbsp; He thought it below my dignity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Savigny told a <i>Volksm&auml;hrchen</i> too:</p>
<p>&lsquo;St. Anselm was grown old and infirm, and lay on the
ground among thorns and thistles.&nbsp; <i>Der liebe Gott</i>
said to him, &ldquo;You are very badly lodged there; why
don&rsquo;t you build yourself a house?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Before I take the trouble,&rdquo; said Anselm, &ldquo;I
should like to know how long I have to live.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;About thirty years,&rdquo; said <i>Der liebe
Gott</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, for so short a time,&rdquo; replied
he, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not worth while,&rdquo; and turned himself
round among the thistles.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Franck told me a story of which I had never heard
before.&nbsp; Voltaire had for some reason or other taken a
grudge against the prophet Habakkuk, and affected to find in him
things he never wrote.&nbsp; Somebody took the Bible and began to
demonstrate to him that he was mistaken.&nbsp;
&lsquo;<i>C&rsquo;est &eacute;gal</i>,&rsquo; he said
impatiently, &lsquo;<i>Habakkuk &eacute;tait capable de
tout</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Oct.</i> 30, 1853.</p>
<p>I am not in love with the <i>Richtung</i> (tendency) of our
modern novelists.&nbsp; There is abundance of talent; but writing
a pretty, graceful, touching, yet pleasing story is the last
thing our writers nowadays think of.&nbsp; Their novels are party
pamphlets on political or social questions, like <i>Sybil</i>, or
<i>Alton Locke</i>, or <i>Mary Barton</i>, or <i>Uncle Tom</i>;
or they are the most minute and painful dissections of the least
agreeable and beautiful parts of our nature, like those of Miss
Bront&euml;&mdash;<i>Jane Eyre</i> and <i>Villette</i>; or they
are a kind of martyrology, like Mrs. Marsh&rsquo;s <i>Emilia
Wyndham</i>, which makes you almost doubt whether any torments
the heroine would have earned by being naughty could exceed those
she incurred by her virtue.</p>
<p>Where, oh! where is the charming, humane, gentle spirit that
dictated the <i>Vicar of Wakefield</i>&mdash;the spirit <!-- page
137--><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>which Goethe so justly calls <i>vers&ouml;hnend</i>
(reconciling), with all the weaknesses and woes of humanity? . .
. Have you read Thackeray&rsquo;s <i>Esmond</i>?&nbsp; It is a
curious and very successful attempt to imitate the style of our
old novelists. . . .&nbsp; Which of Mrs. Gore&rsquo;s novels are
translated?&nbsp; They are very clever, lively, worldly, bitter,
disagreeable, and entertaining. . . .&nbsp; Miss
Austen&rsquo;s&mdash;are they translated?&nbsp; They are not new,
and are Dutch paintings of every-day people&mdash;very clever,
very true, very <i>un&aelig;sthetic</i>, but amusing.&nbsp; I
have not seen <i>Ruth</i>, by Mrs. Gaskell.&nbsp; I hear it much
admired&mdash;and blamed.&nbsp; It is one of the many proofs of
the desire women now have to <i>friser</i> questionable topics,
and to <i>poser</i> insoluble moral problems.&nbsp; George Sand
has turned their heads in that direction.&nbsp; I think a few
<i>broad</i> scenes or hearty jokes <i>&agrave; la</i> Fielding
were very harmless in comparison.&nbsp; They <i>confounded</i>
nothing. . . .</p>
<p>The <i>Heir of Redcliffe</i> I have not read. . . . I am not
worthy of superhuman flights of virtue&mdash;in a novel.&nbsp; I
want to see how people act and suffer who are as good-for-nothing
as I am myself.&nbsp; Then I have the sinful pretension to be
amused, whereas all our novelists want to reform us, and to show
us what a hideous place this world is: <i>Ma foi</i>, <i>je ne le
sais que trop</i>, without their help.</p>
<p>The <i>Head of the Family</i> has some merits. . . . But there
is too much affliction and misery and frenzy.&nbsp; The heroine
is one of those creatures now so common (in novels), who remind
me of a poor bird tied to a stake (as was once the cruel sport of
boys) to be &lsquo;shyed&rsquo; at (<i>i.e.</i> pelted) till it
died; only our gentle lady-writers at the end of all untie the
poor battered bird, and assure us that it is never the worse for
all the blows it has had&mdash;nay, the better&mdash;and that
now, with its broken wings and torn feathers and bruised body, it
is going to be quite happy.&nbsp; No, fair ladies, you know that
it is not so&mdash;<i>resigned</i>, if you please, but make me no
shams of happiness out of such wrecks.</p>

<p>In politics Mrs. Austin was a philosophical Tory.&nbsp;
Radicalism she detested, and she and most of her friends seem to
have regarded it as moribund.&nbsp; &lsquo;The <!-- page 138--><a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>Radical
party is evidently effete,&rsquo; she writes to M. Victor Cousin;
the probable &lsquo;leader of the Tory party&rsquo; is Mr.
Gladstone.&nbsp; &lsquo;The people must be instructed, must be
guided, must be, in short, governed,&rsquo; she writes elsewhere;
and in a letter to Dr. Whewell, she says that the state of things
in France fills &lsquo;me with the deepest anxiety on one
point,&mdash;the point on which the permanency of our
institutions and our salvation as a nation turn.&nbsp; Are our
higher classes able to keep the lead of the rest?&nbsp; If they
are, we are safe; if not, I agree with my poor dear Charles
Buller&mdash;<i>our</i> turn must come.&nbsp; Now Cambridge and
Oxford must really look to this.&rsquo;&nbsp; The belief in the
power of the Universities to stem the current of democracy is
charming.&nbsp; She grew to regard Carlyle as &lsquo;one of the
dissolvents of the age&mdash;as mischievous as his extravagances
will let him be&rsquo;; speaks of Kingsley and Maurice as
&lsquo;pernicious&rsquo;; and talks of John Stuart Mill as a
&lsquo;demagogue.&rsquo;&nbsp; She was no
<i>doctrinaire</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;One ounce of education demanded
is worth a pound imposed.&nbsp; It is no use to give the meat
before you give the hunger.&rsquo;&nbsp; She was delighted at a
letter of St. Hilaire&rsquo;s, in which he said, &lsquo;We have a
system and no results; you have results and no
system.&rsquo;&nbsp; Yet she had a deep sympathy with the wants
of the people.&nbsp; She was horrified at something Babbage told
her of the population of some of the manufacturing towns who are
<i>worked out</i> before they attain to thirty years of
age.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I am persuaded that the remedy will not,
cannot come from the people,&rsquo; she adds.&nbsp; Many of her
letters are concerned with the question of the higher education
of women.&nbsp; She discusses Buckle&rsquo;s lecture on
&lsquo;The Influence of Women upon the Progress of
Knowledge,&rsquo; admits to M. Guizot that women&rsquo;s
intellectual life is largely coloured by the emotions, but adds:
<!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>&lsquo;One is not precisely a fool because one&rsquo;s
opinions are greatly influenced by one&rsquo;s affections.&nbsp;
The opinions of men are often influenced by worse
things.&rsquo;&nbsp; Dr. Whewell consults her about lecturing
women on Plato, being slightly afraid lest people should think it
ridiculous; Comte writes her elaborate letters on the relation of
women to progress; and Mr. Gladstone promises that Mrs. Gladstone
will carry out at Hawarden the suggestions contained in one of
her pamphlets.&nbsp; She was always very practical, and never
lost her admiration for plain sewing.</p>
<p>All through the book we come across interesting and amusing
things.&nbsp; She gets St. Hilaire to order a large, sensible
bonnet for her in Paris, which was at once christened the
&lsquo;Aristotelian,&rsquo; and was supposed to be the only
useful bonnet in England.&nbsp; Grote has to leave Paris after
the <i>coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat</i>, he tells her, because he
cannot bear to see the establishment of a Greek tyrant.&nbsp;
Alfred de Vigny, Macaulay, John Stirling, Southey, Alexis de
Tocqueville, Hallam, and Jean Jacques Amp&egrave;re all
contribute to these pleasant pages.&nbsp; She seems to have
inspired the warmest feelings of friendship in those who knew
her.&nbsp; Guizot writes to her: &lsquo;Madame de Sta&euml;l used
to say that the best thing in the world was a serious
Frenchman.&nbsp; I turn the compliment, and say that the best
thing in the world is an affectionate Englishman.&nbsp; How much
more an Englishwoman!&nbsp; Given equal qualities, a woman is
always more charming than a man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lucie Austin, afterwards Lady Duff Gordon, was born in
1821.&nbsp; Her chief playfellow was John Stuart Mill, and Jeremy
Bentham&rsquo;s garden was her playground.&nbsp; She was a
lovely, romantic child, who was always wanting the flowers to
talk to her, <!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>and used to invent the most
wonderful stories about animals, of whom she was passionately
fond.&nbsp; In 1834 Mrs. Austin decided on leaving England, and
Sydney Smith wrote his immortal letter to the little girl:</p>
<blockquote><p>Lucie, Lucie, my dear child, don&rsquo;t tear your
frock: tearing frocks is not of itself a proof of genius.&nbsp;
But write as your mother writes, act as your mother acts: be
frank, loyal, affectionate, simple, honest, and then integrity or
laceration of frock is of little import.&nbsp; And Lucie, dear
child, mind your arithmetic.&nbsp; You know in the first sum of
yours I ever saw there was a mistake.&nbsp; You had carried two
(as a cab is licensed to do), and you ought, dear Lucie, to have
carried but one.&nbsp; Is this a trifle?&nbsp; What would life be
without arithmetic but a scene of horrors?&nbsp; You are going to
Boulogne, the city of debts, peopled by men who have never
understood arithmetic.&nbsp; By the time you return, I shall
probably have received my first paralytic stroke, and shall have
lost all recollection of you.&nbsp; Therefore I now give you my
parting advice&mdash;don&rsquo;t marry anybody who has not a
tolerable understanding and a thousand a year.&nbsp; And God
bless you, dear child.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At Boulogne she sat next Heine at <i>table
d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;He heard me speak German to
my mother, and soon began to talk to me, and then said,
&ldquo;When you go back to England, you can tell your friends
that you have seen Heinrich Heine.&rdquo;&nbsp; I replied,
&ldquo;And who is Heinrich Heine?&rdquo;&nbsp; He laughed
heartily and took no offence at my ignorance; and we used to
lounge on the end of the pier together, where he told me stories
in which fish, mermaids, water-sprites and a very funny old
French fiddler with a poodle were mixed up in the most fanciful
manner, sometimes humorous, and very often pathetic, especially
when the water-sprites brought him greetings from the &ldquo;Nord
See.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was . . . so <!-- page 141--><a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>kind to me
and so sarcastic to every one else.&rsquo;&nbsp; Twenty years
afterwards the little girl whose &lsquo;braune Augen&rsquo; Heine
had celebrated in his charming poem <i>Wenn ick an deinem
Hause</i>, used to go and see the dying poet in Paris.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It does one good,&rsquo; he said to her, &lsquo;to see a
woman who does not carry about a broken heart, to be mended by
all sorts of men, like the women here, who do not see that a
total want of heart is their real failing.&rsquo;&nbsp; On
another occasion he said to her: &lsquo;I have now made peace
with the whole world, and at last also with God, who sends thee
to me as a beautiful angel of death: I shall certainly soon
die.&rsquo;&nbsp; Lady Duff Gordon said to him: &lsquo;Poor Poet,
do you still retain such splendid illusions, that you transform a
travelling Englishwoman into Azrael?&nbsp; That used not to be
the case, for you always disliked us.&rsquo;&nbsp; He answered:
&lsquo;Yes, I do not know what possessed me to dislike the
English, . . . it really was only petulance; I never hated them,
indeed, I never knew them.&nbsp; I was only once in England, but
knew no one, and found London very dreary, and the people and the
streets odious.&nbsp; But England has revenged herself well; she
has sent me most excellent friends&mdash;thyself and Milnes, that
good Milnes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There are delightful letters from Dicky Doyle here, with the
most amusing drawings, one of the present Sir Robert Peel as he
made his maiden speech in the House being excellent; and the
various descriptions of Hassan&rsquo;s performances are extremely
amusing.&nbsp; Hassan was a black boy, who had been turned away
by his master because he was going blind, and was found by Lady
Duff Gordon one night sitting on her doorstep.&nbsp; She took
care of him, and had him cured, and he seems to have been a
constant source of delight to every one.&nbsp; On <!-- page
142--><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>one occasion, &lsquo;when Prince Louis Napoleon (the
late Emperor of the French) came in unexpectedly, he gravely
said: &ldquo;Please, my lady, I ran out and bought twopennyworth
of sprats for the Prince, and for the honour of the
house.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; Here is an amusing letter from Mrs.
Norton:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">My dear Lucie</span>,&mdash;We
have never thanked you for the <i>red Pots</i>, which no early
Christian should be without, and which add that finishing stroke
to the splendour of our demesne, which was supposed to depend on
a roc&rsquo;s egg, in less intelligent times.&nbsp; We have now a
warm <i>Pompeian</i> appearance, and the constant contemplation
of these classical objects favours the beauty of the facial line;
for what can be deducted from the great fact, apparent in all the
states of antiquity, that <i>straight noses</i> were the ancient
custom, but the logical assumption that the constant habit of
turning up the nose at unsightly objects&mdash;such as the
National Gallery and other offensive and obtrusive
things&mdash;has produced the modern divergence from the true and
proper line of profile?&nbsp; I rejoice to think that we
ourselves are exempt.&nbsp; I attribute this to our love of
Pompeian Pots (on account of the beauty and distinction of this
Pot&rsquo;s shape I spell it with a big P), which has kept us
straight in a world of crookedness.&nbsp; The pursuit of profiles
under difficulties&mdash;how much more rare than a pursuit of
knowledge!&nbsp; Talk of setting good examples before our
children!&nbsp; Bah! let us set good Pompeian Pots before our
children, and when they grow up they will not depart from
them.</p>

<p>Lady Duff Gordon&rsquo;s <i>Letters from the Cape</i>, and her
brilliant translation of <i>The Amber Witch</i>, are, of course,
well known.&nbsp; The latter book was, with Lady Wilde&rsquo;s
translation of <i>Sidonia the Sorceress</i>, my favourite
romantic reading when a boy.&nbsp; Her letters from Egypt are
wonderfully vivid and picturesque.&nbsp; Here is an interesting
bit of art criticism:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sheykh Yoosuf laughed so heartily over a print in
an illustrated paper from a picture of Hilton&rsquo;s of Rebekah
<!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&lsquo;Sidi Ibraheem&rsquo; (Abraham&rsquo;s chief servant)
<i>kneeling</i> before the girl he was sent to fetch, like an old
fool without his turban, and Rebekah and the other girls in queer
fancy dresses, and the camels with snouts like pigs.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If the painter could not go into &ldquo;Es Sham&rdquo; to
see how the Arab really look,&rsquo; said Sheykh Yoosuf,
&lsquo;why did he not paint a well in England, with girls like
English peasants&mdash;at least it would have looked natural to
English people? and the wekeel would not seem so like a madman if
he had taken off a hat!&rsquo;&nbsp; I cordially agree with
Yoosuf&rsquo;s art criticism.&nbsp; <i>Fancy</i> pictures of
Eastern things are hopelessly absurd.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mrs. Ross has certainly produced a most fascinating volume,
and her book is one of the books of the season.&nbsp; It is
edited with tact and judgment.</p>
<p class="gutcpm"><i>Three Generations of English
Women</i>.&nbsp; <i>Memoirs and Correspondence of Susannah
Taylor</i>, <i>Sarah Austin</i>, <i>and Lady Duff
Gordon</i>.&nbsp; By Janet Ross, author of Italian Sketches, Land
of Manfred, etc.&nbsp; (Fisher Unwin.)</p>
<h2>POETRY AND PRISON<br />
(<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, January 3, 1889.)</h2>
<p>Prison has had an admirable effect on Mr. Wilfrid Blunt as a
poet.&nbsp; The <i>Love Sonnets of Proteus</i>, in spite of their
clever Musset-like modernities and their swift brilliant wit,
were but affected or fantastic at best.&nbsp; They were simply
the records of passing moods and moments, of which some were sad
and others sweet, and not a few shameful.&nbsp; Their subject was
not of high or serious import.&nbsp; They contained much that was
wilful and weak.&nbsp; In <i>Vinculis</i>, upon the other hand,
is a book that stirs one by its fine sincerity of purpose, its
lofty and impassioned thought, its depth and ardour of intense
feeling.&nbsp; &lsquo;Imprisonment,&rsquo; says Mr. Blunt in his
preface, &lsquo;is a reality of discipline most useful <!-- page
144--><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>to
the modern soul, lapped as it is in physical sloth and
self-indulgence.&nbsp; Like a sickness or a spiritual retreat it
purifies and ennobles; and the soul emerges from it stronger and
more self-contained.&rsquo;&nbsp; To him, certainly, it has been
a mode of purification.&nbsp; The opening sonnets, composed in
the bleak cell of Galway Gaol, and written down on the flyleaves
of the prisoner&rsquo;s prayer-book, are full of things nobly
conceived and nobly uttered, and show that though Mr. Balfour may
enforce &lsquo;plain living&rsquo; by his prison regulations, he
cannot prevent &lsquo;high thinking&rsquo; or in any way limit or
constrain the freedom of a man&rsquo;s soul.&nbsp; They are, of
course, intensely personal in expression.&nbsp; They could not
fail to be so.&nbsp; But the personality that they reveal has
nothing petty or ignoble about it.&nbsp; The petulant cry of the
shallow egoist which was the chief characteristic of the <i>Love
Sonnets of Proteus</i> is not to be found here.&nbsp; In its
place we have wild grief and terrible scorn, fierce rage and
flame-like passion.&nbsp; Such a sonnet as the following comes
out of the very fire of heart and brain:</p>
<blockquote><p>God knows, &rsquo;twas not with a fore-reasoned
plan<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I left the easeful dwellings of my peace,<br />
And sought this combat with ungodly Man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And ceaseless still through years that do not
cease<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have warred with Powers and Principalities.<br />
My natural soul, ere yet these strifes began,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was as a sister diligent to please<br />
And loving all, and most the human clan.</p>
<p>God knows it.&nbsp; And He knows how the world&rsquo;s
tears<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Touched me.&nbsp; And He is witness of my wrath,<br
/>
How it was kindled against murderers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who slew for gold, and how upon their path<br />
I met them.&nbsp; Since which day the World in arms<br />
Strikes at my life with angers and alarms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this sonnet has all the strange strength of that despair
which is but the prelude to a larger hope:</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>I thought to do a deed of
chivalry,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; An act of worth, which haply in her sight<br />
Who was my mistress should recorded be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And of the nations.&nbsp; And, when thus the
fight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Faltered and men once bold with faces white<br />
Turned this and that way in excuse to flee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I only stood, and by the foeman&rsquo;s might<br />
Was overborne and mangled cruelly.</p>
<p>Then crawled I to her feet, in whose dear cause<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I made this venture, and &lsquo;Behold,&rsquo; I
said,<br />
&lsquo;How I am wounded for thee in these wars.&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But she, &lsquo;Poor cripple, would&rsquo;st thou I
should wed<br />
A limbless trunk?&rsquo; and laughing turned from me.<br />
Yet she was fair, and her name &lsquo;Liberty.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sonnet beginning</p>
<blockquote><p>A prison is a convent without God&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Poverty, Chastity, Obedience<br />
Its precepts are:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is very fine; and this, written just after entering the gaol,
is powerful:</p>
<blockquote><p>Naked I came into the world of pleasure,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And naked come I to this house of pain.<br />
Here at the gate I lay down my life&rsquo;s treasure,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My pride, my garments and my name with men.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The world and I henceforth shall be as twain,<br />
No sound of me shall pierce for good or ill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; These walls of grief.&nbsp; Nor shall I hear the
vain<br />
Laughter and tears of those who love me still.</p>
<p>Within, what new life waits me!&nbsp; Little ease,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cold lying, hunger, nights of wakefulness,<br />
Harsh orders given, no voice to soothe or please,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Poor thieves for friends, for books rules
meaningless;<br />
This is the grave&mdash;nay, hell.&nbsp; Yet, Lord of Might,<br
/>
Still in Thy light my spirit shall see light.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, indeed, all the sonnets are worth reading, and <i>The
Canon of Aughrim</i>, the longest poem in the book, is a most
masterly and dramatic description of the tragic life of the Irish
peasant.&nbsp; Literature is not much indebted to Mr. Balfour for
his sophistical <i>Defence of Philosophic Doubt</i>, which is one
of the <!-- page 146--><a name="page146"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 146</span>dullest books we know, but it must
be admitted that by sending Mr. Blunt to gaol he has converted a
clever rhymer into an earnest and deep-thinking poet.&nbsp; The
narrow confines of a prison cell seem to suit the
&lsquo;sonnet&rsquo;s scanty plot of ground,&rsquo; and an unjust
imprisonment for a noble cause strengthens as well as deepens the
nature.</p>

<h2>THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO WALT WHITMAN<br />
(<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, January 25, 1889.)</h2>
<p>&lsquo;No one will get to my verses who insists upon viewing
them as a literary performance . . . or as aiming mainly towards
art and &aelig;stheticism.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Leaves of
Grass</i> . . . has mainly been the outcropping of my own
emotional and other personal nature&mdash;an attempt, from first
to last, to put <i>a Person</i>, a human being (myself, in the
latter half of the Nineteenth Century in America,) freely, fully
and truly on record.&nbsp; I could not find any similar personal
record in current literature that satisfied me.&rsquo;&nbsp; In
these words Walt Whitman gives us the true attitude we should
adopt towards his work, having, indeed, a much saner view of the
value and meaning of that work than either his eloquent admirers
or noisy detractors can boast of possessing.&nbsp; His last book,
<i>November Boughs</i>, as he calls it, published in the winter
of the old man&rsquo;s life, reveals to us, not indeed a
soul&rsquo;s tragedy, for its last note is one of joy and hope,
and noble and unshaken faith in all that is fine and worthy of
such faith, but certainly the drama of a human soul, and puts on
<!-- page 147--><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>record with a simplicity that has in it both sweetness
and strength the record of his spiritual development, and of the
aim and motive both of the manner and the matter of his
work.&nbsp; His strange mode of expression is shown in these
pages to have been the result of deliberate and self-conscious
choice.&nbsp; The &lsquo;barbaric yawp&rsquo; which he sent over
&lsquo;the roofs of the world&rsquo; so many years ago, and which
wrung from Mr. Swinburne&rsquo;s lip such lofty panegyric in song
and such loud clamorous censure in prose, appears here in what
will be to many an entirely new light.&nbsp; For in his very
rejection of art Walt Whitman is an artist.&nbsp; He tried to
produce a certain effect by certain means and he succeeded.&nbsp;
There is much method in what many have termed his madness, too
much method, indeed, some may be tempted to fancy.</p>
<p>In the story of his life, as he tells it to us, we find him at
the age of sixteen beginning a definite and philosophical study
of literature:</p>
<blockquote><p>Summers and falls, I used to go off, sometimes for
a week at a stretch, down in the country, or to Long
Island&rsquo;s seashores&mdash;there, in the presence of outdoor
influences, I went over thoroughly the Old and New Testaments,
and absorb&rsquo;d (probably to better advantage for me than in
any library or indoor room&mdash;it makes such difference
<i>where</i> you read) Shakspere, Ossian, the best translated
versions I could get of Homer, Eschylus, Sophocles, the old
German Nibelungen, the ancient Hindoo poems, and one or two other
masterpieces, Dante&rsquo;s among them.&nbsp; As it
happen&rsquo;d, I read the latter mostly in an old wood.&nbsp;
The <i>Iliad</i> . . . I read first thoroughly on the peninsula
of Orient, northeast end of Long Island, in a shelter&rsquo;d
hollow of rock and sand, with the sea on each side.&nbsp; (I have
wonder&rsquo;d since why I was not overwhelm&rsquo;d by those
mighty masters.&nbsp; Likely because I read them, as described,
in the full presence of Nature, under the sun, with the
far-spreading landscapes and vistas, or the sea rolling in.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>Edgar Allan Poe&rsquo;s amusing bit of dogmatism that,
for our occasions and our day, &lsquo;there can be no such thing
as a long poem,&rsquo; fascinated him.&nbsp; &lsquo;The same
thought had been haunting my mind before,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;but Poe&rsquo;s argument . . . work&rsquo;d the sum out,
and proved it to me,&rsquo; and the English translation of the
Bible seems to have suggested to him the possibility of a poetic
form which, while retaining the spirit of poetry, would still be
free from the trammels of rhyme and of a definite metrical
system.&nbsp; Having thus, to a certain degree, settled upon what
one might call the &lsquo;technique&rsquo; of Whitmanism, he
began to brood upon the nature of that spirit which was to give
life to the strange form.&nbsp; The central point of the poetry
of the future seemed to him to be necessarily &lsquo;an identical
body and soul, a personality,&rsquo; in fact, which personality,
he tells us frankly, &lsquo;after many considerations and
ponderings I deliberately settled should be myself.&rsquo;&nbsp;
However, for the true creation and revealing of this personality,
at first only dimly felt, a new stimulus was needed.&nbsp; This
came from the Civil War.&nbsp; After describing the many dreams
and passions of his boyhood and early manhood, he goes on to
say:</p>
<blockquote><p>These, however, and much more might have gone on
and come to naught (almost positively would have come to naught,)
if a sudden, vast, terrible, direct and indirect stimulus for new
and national declamatory expression had not been given to
me.&nbsp; It is certain, I say, that although I had made a start
before, only from the occurrence of the Secession War, and what
it show&rsquo;d me as by flashes of lightning, with the emotional
depths it sounded and arous&rsquo;d (of course, I don&rsquo;t
mean in my own heart only, I saw it just as plainly in others, in
millions)&mdash;that only from the strong flare and provocation
of that war&rsquo;s sights and scenes the final reasons-for-being
of an autochthonic and passionate song definitely came forth.</p>
<p><!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>I went down to the war fields of Virginia . . . lived
thenceforward in camp&mdash;saw great battles and the days and
nights afterward&mdash;partook of all the fluctuations, gloom,
despair, hopes again arous&rsquo;d, courage evoked&mdash;death
readily risk&rsquo;d&mdash;<i>the cause</i>, too&mdash;along and
filling those agonistic and lurid following years . . . the real
parturition years . . . of this henceforth homogeneous
Union.&nbsp; Without those three or four years and the
experiences they gave, <i>Leaves of Grass</i> would not now be
existing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having thus obtained the necessary stimulus for the quickening
and awakening of the personal self, some day to be endowed with
universality, he sought to find new notes of song, and, passing
beyond the mere passion for expression, he aimed at
&lsquo;Suggestiveness&rsquo; first.</p>
<blockquote><p>I round and finish little, if anything; and could
not, consistently with my scheme.&nbsp; The reader will have his
or her part to do, just as much as I have had mine.&nbsp; I seek
less to state or display any theme or thought, and more to bring
you, reader, into the atmosphere of the theme or
thought&mdash;there to pursue your own flight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another &lsquo;impetus-word&rsquo; is Comradeship, and other
&lsquo;word-signs&rsquo; are Good Cheer, Content and Hope.&nbsp;
Individuality, especially, he sought for:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have allow&rsquo;d the stress of my poems from
beginning to end to bear upon American individuality and assist
it&mdash;not only because that is a great lesson in Nature, amid
all her generalizing laws, but as counterpoise to the leveling
tendencies of Democracy&mdash;and for other reasons.&nbsp;
Defiant of ostensible literary and other conventions, I avowedly
chant &lsquo;the great pride of man in himself,&rsquo; and permit
it to be more or less a <i>motif</i> of nearly all my
verse.&nbsp; I think this pride is indispensable to an
American.&nbsp; I think it not inconsistent with obedience,
humility, deference, and self-questioning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 150--><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>A new theme also was to be found in the relation of the
sexes, conceived in a natural, simple and healthy form, and he
protests against poor Mr. William Rossetti&rsquo;s attempt to
Bowdlerise and expurgate his song.</p>
<blockquote><p>From another point of view <i>Leaves of Grass</i>
is avowedly the song of Sex and Amativeness, and even
Animality&mdash;though meanings that do not usually go along with
these words are behind all, and will duly emerge; and all are
sought to be lifted into a different light and atmosphere.&nbsp;
Of this feature, intentionally palpable in a few lines, I shall
only say the espousing principle of those lines so gives breath
to my whole scheme that the bulk of the pieces might as well have
been left unwritten were those lines omitted. . . .</p>
<p>Universal as are certain facts and symptoms of communities . .
. there is nothing so rare in modern conventions and poetry as
their normal recognizance.&nbsp; Literature is always calling in
the doctor for consultation and confession, and always giving
evasions and swathing suppressions in place of that &lsquo;heroic
nudity&rsquo; on which only a genuine diagnosis . . . can be
built.&nbsp; And in respect to editions of <i>Leaves of Grass</i>
in time to come (if there should be such) I take occasion now to
confirm those lines with the settled convictions and deliberate
renewals of thirty years, and to hereby prohibit, as far as word
of mine can do so, any elision of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But beyond all these notes and moods and motives is the lofty
spirit of a grand and free acceptance of all things that are
worthy of existence.&nbsp; He desired, he says, &lsquo;to
formulate a poem whose every thought or fact should directly or
indirectly be or connive at an implicit belief in the wisdom,
health, mystery, beauty of every process, every concrete object,
every human or other existence, not only consider&rsquo;d from
the point of view of all, but of each.&rsquo;&nbsp; His two final
utterances are that &lsquo;really great poetry is always . . .
the result of a national spirit, and not the privilege <!-- page
151--><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>of
a polish&rsquo;d and select few&rsquo;; and that &lsquo;the
strongest and sweetest songs yet remain to be sung.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Such are the views contained in the opening essay <i>A
Backward Glance O&rsquo;er Travel&rsquo;d Roads</i>, as he calls
it; but there are many other essays in this fascinating volume,
some on poets such as Burns and Lord Tennyson, for whom Walt
Whitman has a profound admiration; some on old actors and
singers, the elder Booth, Forrest, Alboni and Mario being his
special favourites; others on the native Indians, on the Spanish
element in American nationality, on Western slang, on the poetry
of the Bible, and on Abraham Lincoln.&nbsp; But Walt Whitman is
at his best when he is analysing his own work and making schemes
for the poetry of the future.&nbsp; Literature, to him, has a
distinctly social aim.&nbsp; He seeks to build up the masses by
&lsquo;building up grand individuals.&rsquo;&nbsp; And yet
literature itself must be preceded by noble forms of life.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The best literature is always the result of something far
greater than itself&mdash;not the hero but the portrait of the
hero.&nbsp; Before there can be recorded history or poem there
must be the transaction.&rsquo;&nbsp; Certainly, in Walt
Whitman&rsquo;s views there is a largeness of vision, a healthy
sanity and a fine ethical purpose.&nbsp; He is not to be placed
with the professional litt&eacute;rateurs of his country, Boston
novelists, New York poets and the like.&nbsp; He stands apart,
and the chief value of his work is in its prophecy, not in its
performance.&nbsp; He has begun a prelude to larger themes.&nbsp;
He is the herald to a new era.&nbsp; As a man he is the precursor
of a fresh type.&nbsp; He is a factor in the heroic and spiritual
evolution of the human being.&nbsp; If Poetry has passed him by,
Philosophy will take note of him.</p>

class="pagenum">p. 152</span>IRISH FAIRY TALES<br />
(<i>Woman&rsquo;s World</i>, February 1889.)</h2>
<p>&lsquo;The various collectors of Irish folk-lore,&rsquo; says
Mr. W. B. Yeats in his charming little book <i>Fairy and Folk
Tales of the Irish Peasantry</i>, &lsquo;have, from our point of
view, one great merit, and from the point of view of others, one
great fault.&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>They have made their work literature rather than
science, and told us of the Irish peasantry rather than of the
primitive religion of mankind, or whatever else the folk-lorists
are on the gad after.&nbsp; To be considered scientists they
should have tabulated all their tales in forms like
grocers&rsquo; bills&mdash;item the fairy king, item the
queen.&nbsp; Instead of this they have caught the very voice of
the people, the very pulse of life, each giving what was most
noticed in his day.&nbsp; Croker and Lover, full of the ideas of
harum-scarum Irish gentility, saw everything humorized.&nbsp; The
impulse of the Irish literature of their time came from a class
that did not&mdash;mainly for political reasons&mdash;take the
populace seriously, and imagined the country as a
humorist&rsquo;s Arcadia; its passion, its gloom, its tragedy,
they knew nothing of.&nbsp; What they did was not wholly false;
they merely magnified an irresponsible type, found oftenest among
boatmen, carmen, and gentlemen&rsquo;s servants, into the type of
a whole nation, and created the stage Irishman.&nbsp; The writers
of &rsquo;Forty-eight, and the famine combined, burst their
bubble.&nbsp; Their work had the dash as well as the shallowness
of an ascendant and idle class, and in Croker is touched
everywhere with beauty&mdash;a gentle Arcadian beauty.&nbsp;
Carleton, a peasant born, has in many of his stories, . . . more
especially in his ghost stories, a much more serious way with
him, for all his humour.&nbsp; Kennedy, an old bookseller in
Dublin, who seems to have had a something of genuine belief in
the fairies, comes next in time.&nbsp; He has far less literary
faculty, but is wonderfully accurate, giving often the very words
the stories were told in.&nbsp; But the best book since Croker is
Lady Wilde&rsquo;s <i>Ancient </i><!-- page 153--><a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span><i>Legends</i>.&nbsp; The humour has all given way to
pathos and tenderness.&nbsp; We have here the innermost heart of
the Celt in the moments he has grown to love through years of
persecution, when, cushioning himself about with dreams, and
hearing fairy-songs in the twilight, he ponders on the soul and
on the dead.&nbsp; Here is the Celt, only it is the Celt
dreaming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Into a volume of very moderate dimensions, and of extremely
moderate price, Mr. Yeats has collected together the most
characteristic of our Irish folklore stories, grouping them
together according to subject.&nbsp; First come <i>The Trooping
Fairies</i>.&nbsp; The peasants say that these are &lsquo;fallen
angels who were not good enough to be saved, nor bad enough to be
lost&rsquo;; but the Irish antiquarians see in them &lsquo;the
gods of pagan Ireland,&rsquo; who, &lsquo;when no longer
worshipped and fed with offerings, dwindled away in the popular
imagination, and now are only a few spans high.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Their chief occupations are feasting, fighting, making love, and
playing the most beautiful music.&nbsp; &lsquo;They have only one
industrious person amongst them, the <i>lepra-caun</i>&mdash;the
shoemaker.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is his duty to repair their shoes when
they wear them out with dancing.&nbsp; Mr. Yeats tells us that
&lsquo;near the village of Ballisodare is a little woman who
lived amongst them seven years.&nbsp; When she came home she had
no toes&mdash;she had danced them off.&rsquo;&nbsp; On May Eve,
every seventh year, they fight for the harvest, for the best ears
of grain belong to them.&nbsp; An old man informed Mr. Yeats that
he saw them fight once, and that they tore the thatch off a
house.&nbsp; &lsquo;Had any one else been near they would merely
have seen a great wind whirling everything into the air as it
passed.&rsquo;&nbsp; When the wind drives the leaves and straws
before it, &lsquo;that is the fairies, and the peasants take off
their hats and say &ldquo;God <!-- page 154--><a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>bless
them.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; When they are gay, they sing.&nbsp;
Many of the most beautiful tunes of Ireland &lsquo;are only their
music, caught up by eavesdroppers.&rsquo;&nbsp; No prudent
peasant would hum <i>The Pretty Girl Milking the Cow</i> near a
fairy rath, &lsquo;for they are jealous, and do not like to hear
their songs on clumsy mortal lips.&rsquo;&nbsp; Blake once saw a
fairy&rsquo;s funeral.&nbsp; But this, as Mr. Yeats points out,
must have been an English fairy, for the Irish fairies never die;
they are immortal.</p>
<p>Then come <i>The Solitary Fairies</i>, amongst whom we find
the little <i>Lepracaun</i> mentioned above.&nbsp; He has grown
very rich, as he possesses all the treasure-crocks buried in
war-time.&nbsp; In the early part of this century, according to
Croker, they used to show in Tipperary a little shoe forgotten by
the fairy shoemaker.&nbsp; Then there are two rather disreputable
little fairies&mdash;the <i>Cluricaun</i>, who gets intoxicated
in gentlemen&rsquo;s cellars, and the Red Man, who plays unkind
practical jokes.&nbsp; &lsquo;The <i>Fear-Gorta</i> (Man of
Hunger) is an emaciated phantom that goes through the land in
famine time, begging an alms and bringing good luck to the
giver.&rsquo;&nbsp; The <i>Water-sheerie</i> is &lsquo;own
brother to the English Jack-o&rsquo;-Lantern.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;<i>The Leanhaun Shee</i> (fairy mistress) seeks the love
of mortals.&nbsp; If they refuse, she must be their slave; if
they consent, they are hers, and can only escape by finding
another to take their place.&nbsp; The fairy lives on their life,
and they waste away.&nbsp; Death is no escape from her.&nbsp; She
is the Gaelic muse, for she gives inspiration to those she
persecutes.&nbsp; The Gaelic poets die young, for she is
restless, and will not let them remain long on
earth.&rsquo;&nbsp; The <i>Pooka</i> is essentially an animal
spirit, and some have considered him the forefather of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s &lsquo;Puck.&rsquo;&nbsp; He lives on
solitary mountains, and among old ruins <!-- page 155--><a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>&lsquo;grown monstrous with much solitude,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;is of the race of the nightmare.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;He
has many shapes&mdash;is now a horse, . . . now a goat, now an
eagle.&nbsp; Like all spirits, he is only half in the world of
form.&rsquo;&nbsp; The <i>banshee</i> does not care much for our
democratic levelling tendencies; she loves only old families, and
despises the <i>parvenu</i> or the <i>nouveau riche</i>.&nbsp;
When more than one banshee is present, and they wail and sing in
chorus, it is for the death of some holy or great one.&nbsp; An
omen that sometimes accompanies the banshee is &lsquo;. . . an
immense black coach, mounted by a coffin, and drawn by headless
horses driven by a <i>Dullahan</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; A
<i>Dullahan</i> is the most terrible thing in the world.&nbsp; In
1807 two of the sentries stationed outside St. James&rsquo;s Park
saw one climbing the railings, and died of fright.&nbsp; Mr.
Yeats suggests that they are possibly &lsquo;descended from that
Irish giant who swam across the Channel with his head in his
teeth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then come the stories of ghosts, of saints and priests, and of
giants.&nbsp; The ghosts live in a state intermediary between
this world and the next.&nbsp; They are held there by some
earthly longing or affection, or some duty unfulfilled, or anger
against the living; they are those who are too good for hell, and
too bad for heaven.&nbsp; Sometimes they &lsquo;take the forms of
insects, especially of butterflies.&rsquo;&nbsp; The author of
the <i>Parochial Survey of Ireland</i> &lsquo;heard a woman say
to a child who was chasing a butterfly, &ldquo;How do you know it
is not the soul of your grandfather?&rdquo;&nbsp; On November eve
they are abroad, and dance with the fairies.&rsquo;&nbsp; As for
the saints and priests, &lsquo;there are no martyrs in the
stories.&rsquo;&nbsp; That ancient chronicler Giraldus Cambrensis
&lsquo;taunted the Archbishop of Cashel, because no one in
Ireland had received the crown of martyrdom.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our
people <!-- page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>may be barbarous,&rdquo; the prelate
answered, &ldquo;but they have never lifted their hands against
God&rsquo;s saints; but now that a people have come amongst us
who know how to make them (it was just after the English
invasion), we shall have martyrs plentifully.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp;
The giants were the old pagan heroes of Ireland, who grew bigger
and bigger, just as the gods grew smaller and smaller.&nbsp; The
fact is they did not wait for offerings; they took them <i>vi et
armis</i>.</p>
<p>Some of the prettiest stories are those that cluster round
<i>T&iacute;r-na-n-Og</i>.&nbsp; This is the Country of the
Young, &lsquo;for age and death have not found it; neither tears
nor loud laughter have gone near it.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;One man
has gone there and returned.&nbsp; The bard, Oisen, who wandered
away on a white horse, moving on the surface of the foam with his
fairy Niamh, lived there three hundred years, and then returned
looking for his comrades.&nbsp; The moment his foot touched the
earth his three hundred years fell on him, and he was bowed
double, and his beard swept the ground.&nbsp; He described his
sojourn in the Land of Youth to Patrick before he
died.&rsquo;&nbsp; Since then, according to Mr. Yeats,
&lsquo;many have seen it in many places; some in the depths of
lakes, and have heard rising therefrom a vague sound of bells;
more have seen it far off on the horizon, as they peered out from
the western cliffs.&nbsp; Not three years ago a fisherman
imagined that he saw it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Yeats has certainly done his work very well.&nbsp; He has
shown great critical capacity in his selection of the stories,
and his little introductions are charmingly written.&nbsp; It is
delightful to come across a collection of purely imaginative
work, and Mr. Yeats has a very quick instinct in finding out the
best and the most beautiful things in Irish folklore.</p>
<p><!-- page 157--><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>I am also glad to see that he has not confined himself
entirely to prose, but has included Allingham&rsquo;s lovely poem
on <i>The Fairies</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Up the airy mountain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Down the rushy glen,<br />
We daren&rsquo;t go a-hunting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For fear of little men;<br />
Wee folk, good folk,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Trooping all together;<br />
Green jacket, red cap,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And white owl&rsquo;s feather!</p>
<p>Down along the rocky shore<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some make their home,<br />
They live on crispy pancakes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of yellow tide-foam;<br />
Some in the reeds<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the black mountain lake,<br />
With frogs for their watch-dogs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All night awake.</p>
<p>High on the hill-top<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The old King sits;<br />
He is now so old and gray<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He&rsquo;s nigh lost his wits.<br />
With a bridge of white mist<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Columbkill he crosses,<br />
On his stately journeys<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From Slieveleague to Rosses;<br />
Or going up with music,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On cold starry nights,<br />
To sup with the Queen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the gay Northern Lights.</p>

that many of the poems are too fragmentary, too incomplete.&nbsp;
They read like stray scenes out of unfinished plays, like things
only half remembered, or, at best, but dimly seen.&nbsp; But the
architectonic power of construction, the power to build up and
make perfect a harmonious whole, is nearly always the latest, as
it certainly is the highest, development of the artistic
temperament.&nbsp; It is somewhat unfair to expect it in early
work.&nbsp; One quality Mr. Yeats has in a marked degree, a
quality that is not common in the work of our minor poets, and is
therefore all the more welcome to us&mdash;I mean the romantic
temper.&nbsp; He is essentially Celtic, and his verse, at its
best, is Celtic also.&nbsp; Strongly influenced by Keats, he
seems to study how to &lsquo;load every rift with ore,&rsquo; yet
is more fascinated by the beauty of words than by the beauty of
metrical music.&nbsp; The spirit that dominates the whole book is
perhaps more valuable than any individual poem or particular
passage, but this from <i>The Wanderings of Oisin</i> is worth
quoting.&nbsp; It describes the ride to the Island of
Forgetfulness:</p>
<blockquote><p>And the ears of the horse went sinking away in the
hollow light,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For, as drift from a sailor slow drowning the gleams
of the world and the sun,<br />
Ceased on our hands and faces, on hazel and oak leaf, the
light,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the stars were blotted above us, and the whole
of the world was one;</p>
<p><!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>Till the horse gave a whinny; for cumbrous with stems
of the hazel and oak,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of hollies, and hazels, and oak-trees, a valley was
sloping away<br />
From his hoofs in the heavy grasses, with monstrous slumbering
folk,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their mighty and naked and gleaming bodies heaped
loose where they lay.</p>
<p>More comely than man may make them, inlaid with silver and
gold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were arrow and shield and war-axe, arrow and spear
and blade,<br />
And dew-blanched horns, in whose hollows a child of three years
old<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Could sleep on a couch of rushes, round and about
them laid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this, which deals with the old legend of the city lying
under the waters of a lake, is strange and interesting:</p>
<blockquote><p>The maker of the stars and worlds<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sat underneath the market cross,<br />
And the old men were walking, walking,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And little boys played pitch-and-toss.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The props,&rsquo; said He, &lsquo;of stars and
worlds<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are prayers of patient men and good.<br />
The boys, the women, and old men,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening, upon their shadows stood.</p>
<p>A grey professor passing cried,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;How few the mind&rsquo;s intemperance
rule!<br />
What shallow thoughts about deep things!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The world grows old and plays the fool.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The mayor came, leaning his left ear&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There were some talking of the poor&mdash;<br />
And to himself cried, &lsquo;Communist!&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And hurried to the guardhouse door.</p>
<p>The bishop came with open book,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whispering along the sunny path;<br />
There was some talking of man&rsquo;s God,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His God of stupor and of wrath.</p>
<p>The bishop murmured, &lsquo;Atheist!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How sinfully the wicked scoff!&rsquo;<br />
And sent the old men on their way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And drove the boys and women off.</p>
<p><!-- page 160--><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>The place was empty now of people;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A cock came by upon his toes;<br />
An old horse looked across the fence,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And rubbed along the rail his nose.</p>
<p>The maker of the stars and worlds<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To His own house did Him betake,<br />
And on that city dropped a tear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And now that city is a lake.</p>

<p>Mr. Yeats has a great deal of invention, and some of the poems
in his book, such as <i>Mosada</i>, <i>Jealousy</i>, and <i>The
Island of Statues</i>, are very finely conceived.&nbsp; It is
impossible to doubt, after reading his present volume, that he
will some day give us work of high import.&nbsp; Up to this he
has been merely trying the strings of his instrument, running
over the keys.</p>

Poems</i>.&nbsp; By W. B. Yeats.&nbsp; (Kegan Paul.)</p>
<h2>MR. YEATS&rsquo;S <i>WANDERINGS OF OISIN</i><br />
(<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, July 12, 1889.)</h2>
<p>Books of poetry by young writers are usually promissory notes
that are never met.&nbsp; Now and then, however, one comes across
a volume that is so far above the average that one can hardly
resist the fascinating temptation of recklessly prophesying a
fine future for its author.&nbsp; Such a book Mr. Yeats&rsquo;s
<i>Wanderings of Oisin</i> certainly is.&nbsp; Here we find
nobility of treatment and nobility of subject-matter, delicacy of
poetic instinct and richness of imaginative resource.&nbsp;
Unequal and uneven much of the work must be admitted to be.&nbsp;
Mr. Yeats does not try to &lsquo;out-baby&rsquo; Wordsworth, we
are glad to say; but he occasionally succeeds in
&lsquo;out-glittering&rsquo; <!-- page 161--><a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>Keats, and,
here and there, in his book we come across strange crudities and
irritating conceits.&nbsp; But when he is at his best he is very
good.&nbsp; If he has not the grand simplicity of epic treatment,
he has at least something of the largeness of vision that belongs
to the epical temper.&nbsp; He does not rob of their stature the
great heroes of Celtic mythology.&nbsp; He is very na&iuml;ve and
very primitive and speaks of his giants with the air of a
child.&nbsp; Here is a characteristic passage from the account of
Oisin&rsquo;s return from the Island of Forgetfulness:</p>
<blockquote><p>And I rode by the plains of the sea&rsquo;s edge,
where all is barren and grey,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Grey sands on the green of the grasses and over the
dripping trees,<br />
Dripping and doubling landward, as though they would hasten
away<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like an army of old men longing for rest from the
moan of the seas.</p>
<p>Long fled the foam-flakes around me, the winds fled out of the
vast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Snatching the bird in secret, nor knew I, embosomed
apart,<br />
When they froze the cloth on my body like armour riveted fast,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; For Remembrance, lifting her leanness, keened in the
gates of my heart.</p>
<p>Till fattening the winds of the morning, an odour of new-mown
hay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Came, and my forehead fell low, and my tears like
berries fell down;<br />
Later a sound came, half lost in the sound of a shore far
away,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From the great grass-barnacle calling, and later the
shore-winds brown.</p>
<p>If I were as I once was, the gold hooves crushing the sand and
the shells,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Coming forth from the sea like the morning with red
lips murmuring a song,<br />
Not coughing, my head on my knees, and praying, and wroth with
the bells,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I would leave no Saint&rsquo;s head on his body,
though spacious his lands were and strong.</p>
<p><!-- page 162--><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>Making way from the kindling surges, I rode on a
bridle-path,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Much wondering to see upon all hands, of wattle and
woodwork made,<br />
Thy bell-mounted churches, and guardless the sacred cairn and the
earth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And a small and feeble populace stooping with
mattock and spade.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In one or two places the music is faulty, the construction is
sometimes too involved, and the word &lsquo;populace&rsquo; in
the last line is rather infelicitous; but, when all is said, it
is impossible not to feel in these stanzas the presence of the
true poetic spirit.</p>

Poems</i>.&nbsp; By W. B. Yeats.&nbsp; (Kegan Paul.)</p>
<h2>MR. WILLIAM MORRIS&rsquo;S LAST BOOK<br />
(<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, March 2, 1889.)</h2>
<p>Mr. Morris&rsquo;s last book is a piece of pure art
workmanship from beginning to end, and the very remoteness of its
style from the common language and ordinary interests of our day
gives to the whole story a strange beauty and an unfamiliar
charm.&nbsp; It is written in blended prose and verse, like the
medi&aelig;val &lsquo;cante-fable,&rsquo; and tells the tale of
the House of the Wolfings in its struggles against the
legionaries of Rome then advancing into Northern Germany.&nbsp;
It is a kind of Saga, and the language in which the folk-epic, as
we may call it, is set forth recalls the antique dignity and
directness of our English tongue four centuries ago.&nbsp; From
an artistic point of view it may be described as an attempt to
return by a self-conscious effort to the conditions of an earlier
and a fresher age.&nbsp; Attempts of this kind are not uncommon
in the history of art.&nbsp; From some such <!-- page 163--><a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>feeling
came the Pre-Raphaelite movement of our own day and the
archaistic movement of later Greek sculpture.&nbsp; When the
result is beautiful the method is justified, and no shrill
insistence upon a supposed necessity for absolute modernity of
form can prevail against the value of work that has the
incomparable excellence of style.&nbsp; Certainly, Mr.
Morris&rsquo;s work possesses this excellence.&nbsp; His fine
harmonies and rich cadences create in the reader that spirit by
which alone can its own spirit be interpreted, awake in him
something of the temper of romance and, by taking him out of his
own age, place him in a truer and more vital relation to the
great masterpieces of all time.&nbsp; It is a bad thing for an
age to be always looking in art for its own reflection.&nbsp; It
is well that, now and then, we are given work that is nobly
imaginative in its method and purely artistic in its aim.&nbsp;
As we read Mr. Morris&rsquo;s story with its fine alternations of
verse and prose, its decorative and descriptive beauties, its
wonderful handling of romantic and adventurous themes, we cannot
but feel that we are as far removed from the ignoble fiction as
we are from the ignoble facts of our own day.&nbsp; We breathe a
purer air, and have dreams of a time when life had a kind of
poetical quality of its own, and was simple and stately and
complete.</p>
<p>The tragic interest of <i>The House of the Wolfings</i>
centres round the figure of Thiodolf, the great hero of the
tribe.&nbsp; The goddess who loves him gives him, as he goes to
battle against the Romans, a magical hauberk on which rests this
strange fate: that he who wears it shall save his own life and
destroy the life of his land.&nbsp; Thiodolf, finding out this
secret, brings the hauberk back to the Wood-Sun, as she is
called, and chooses death for himself <!-- page 164--><a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>rather than
the ruin of his cause, and so the story ends.</p>
<p>But Mr. Morris has always preferred romance to tragedy, and
set the development of action above the concentration of
passion.&nbsp; His story is like some splendid old tapestry
crowded with stately images and enriched with delicate and
delightful detail.&nbsp; The impression it leaves on us is not of
a single central figure dominating the whole, but rather of a
magnificent design to which everything is subordinated, and by
which everything becomes of enduring import.&nbsp; It is the
whole presentation of the primitive life that really
fascinates.&nbsp; What in other hands would have been mere
arch&aelig;ology is here transformed by quick artistic instinct
and made wonderful for us, and human and full of high
interest.&nbsp; The ancient world seems to have come to life
again for our pleasure.</p>
<p>Of a work so large and so coherent, completed with no less
perfection than it is conceived, it is difficult by mere
quotation to give any adequate idea.&nbsp; This, however, may
serve as an example of its narrative power.&nbsp; The passage
describes the visit of Thiodolf to the Wood-Sun:</p>
<blockquote><p>The moonlight lay in a great flood on the grass
without, and the dew was falling in the coldest hour of the
night, and the earth smelled sweetly: the whole habitation was
asleep now, and there was no sound to be known as the sound of
any creature, save that from the distant meadow came the lowing
of a cow that had lost her calf, and that a white owl was
flitting about near the eaves of the Roof with her wild cry that
sounded like the mocking of merriment now silent.&nbsp; Thiodolf
turned toward the wood, and walked steadily through the scattered
hazel-trees, and thereby into the thick of the beech-trees, whose
boles grew smooth and silver-grey, high and close-set: and so on
and on he went as one going by a well-known <!-- page 165--><a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>path,
though there was no path, till all the moonlight was quenched
under the close roof of the beech-leaves, though yet for all the
darkness, no man could go there and not feel that the roof was
green above him.&nbsp; Still he went on in despite of the
darkness, till at last there was a glimmer before him, that grew
greater till he came unto a small wood-lawn whereon the turf grew
again, though the grass was but thin, because little sunlight got
to it, so close and thick were the tall trees round about it. . .
. Nought looked Thiodolf either at the heavens above, or the
trees, as he strode from off the husk-strewn floor of the beech
wood on to the scanty grass of the lawn, but his eyes looked
straight before him at that which was amidmost of the lawn: and
little wonder was that; for there on a stone chair sat a woman
exceeding fair, clad in glittering raiment, her hair lying as
pale in the moonlight on the grey stone as the barley acres in
the August night before the reaping-hook goes in amongst
them.&nbsp; She sat there as though she were awaiting some one,
and he made no stop nor stay, but went straight up to her, and
took her in his arms, and kissed her mouth and her eyes, and she
him again; and then he sat himself down beside her.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an example of the beauty of the verse we would take this
from the song of the Wood-Sun.&nbsp; It at least shows how
perfectly the poetry harmonizes with the prose, and how natural
the transition is from the one to the other:</p>
<blockquote><p>In many a stead Doom dwelleth, nor sleepeth day
nor night:<br />
The rim of the bowl she kisseth, and beareth the chambering
light<br />
When the kings of men wend happy to the bride-bed from the
board.<br />
It is little to say that she wendeth the edge of the grinded
sword,<br />
When about the house half builded she hangeth many a day;<br />
The ship from the strand she shoveth, and on his wonted way<br />
By the mountain hunter fareth where his foot ne&rsquo;er failed
before:<br />
She is where the high bank crumbles at last on the river&rsquo;s
shore:<br />
<!-- page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>The mower&rsquo;s scythe she whetteth; and lulleth the
shepherd to sleep<br />
Where the deadly ling-worm wakeneth in the desert of the
sheep.<br />
Now we that come of the God-kin of her redes for ourselves we
wot,<br />
But her will with the lives of men-folk and their ending know we
not.<br />
So therefore I bid thee not fear for thyself of Doom and her
deed.<br />
But for me: and I bid thee hearken to the helping of my need.<br
/>
Or else&mdash;Art thou happy in life, or lusteth thou to die<br
/>
In the flower of thy days, when thy glory and thy longing bloom
on high?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last chapter of the book in which we are told of the great
feast made for the dead is so finely written that we cannot
refrain from quoting this passage:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now was the glooming falling upon the earth; but
the Hall was bright within even as the Hall-Sun had
promised.&nbsp; Therein was set forth the Treasure of the
Wolfings; fair cloths were hung on the walls, goodly broidered
garments on the pillars: goodly brazen cauldrons and fair-carven
chests were set down in nooks where men could see them well, and
vessels of gold and silver were set all up and down the tables of
the feast.&nbsp; The pillars also were wreathed with flowers, and
flowers hung garlanded from the walls over the precious hangings;
sweet gums and spices were burning in fair-wrought censers of
brass, and so many candles were alight under the Roof, that
scarce had it looked more ablaze when the Romans had litten the
faggots therein for its burning amidst the hurry of the Morning
Battle.</p>
<p>There then they fell to feasting, hallowing in the high-tide
of their return with victory in their hands: and the dead corpses
of Thiodolf and Otter, clad in precious glittering raiment,
looked down on them from the High-seat, and the kindreds
worshipped them and were glad; and they drank the Cup to them
before any others, were they Gods or men.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In days of uncouth realism and unimaginative imitation, it is
a high pleasure to welcome work of <!-- page 167--><a

kind.&nbsp; It is a work in which all lovers of literature cannot
fail to delight.</p>

<h2>SOME LITERARY NOTES<br />
(<i>Woman&rsquo;s World</i>, April 1889.)</h2>
<p>&lsquo;In modern life,&rsquo; said Matthew Arnold once,
&lsquo;you cannot well enter a monastery; but you can enter the
Wordsworth Society.&rsquo;&nbsp; I fear that this will sound to
many a somewhat uninviting description of this admirable and
useful body, whose papers and productions have been recently
published by Professor Knight, under the title of
<i>Wordsworthiana</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;Plain living and high
thinking&rsquo; are not popular ideals.&nbsp; Most people prefer
to live in luxury, and to think with the majority.&nbsp; However,
there is really nothing in the essays and addresses of the
Wordsworth Society that need cause the public any unnecessary
alarm; and it is gratifying to note that, although the society is
still in the first blush of enthusiasm, it has not yet insisted
upon our admiring Wordsworth&rsquo;s inferior work.&nbsp; It
praises what is worthy of praise, reverences what should be
reverenced, and explains what does not require explanation.&nbsp;
One paper is quite delightful; it is from the pen of Mr.
Rawnsley, and deals with such reminiscences of Wordsworth as
still linger among the peasantry of Westmoreland.&nbsp; Mr.
Rawnsley grew up, he tells us, in the immediate vicinity of the
present Poet-Laureate&rsquo;s old home in Lincolnshire, and had
been struck with the swiftness with which,</p>
<blockquote><p>As year by year the labourer tills<br />
His wonted glebe, or lops the glades,</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 168--><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>the memories of the poet of the Somersby Wold had
&lsquo;faded from off the circle of the hills&rsquo;&mdash;had,
indeed, been astonished to note how little real interest was
taken in him or his fame, and how seldom his works were met with
in the houses of the rich or poor in the very
neighbourhood.&nbsp; Accordingly, when he came to reside in the
Lake Country, he endeavoured to find out what of
Wordsworth&rsquo;s memory among the men of the Dales still
lingered on&mdash;how far he was still a moving presence among
them&mdash;how far his works had made their way into the cottages
and farmhouses of the valleys.&nbsp; He also tried to discover
how far the race of Westmoreland and Cumberland
farm-folk&mdash;the &lsquo;Matthews&rsquo; and the
&lsquo;Michaels&rsquo; of the poet, as described by
him&mdash;were real or fancy pictures, or how far the characters
of the Dalesmen had been altered in any remarkable manner by
tourist influences during the thirty-two years that have passed
since the Lake poet was laid to rest.</p>
<p>With regard to the latter point, it will be remembered that
Mr. Ruskin, writing in 1876, said that &lsquo;the Border
peasantry, painted with absolute fidelity by Scott and
Wordsworth,&rsquo; are, as hitherto, a scarcely injured race;
that in his fields at Coniston he had men who might have fought
with Henry <span class="smcap">v.</span> at Agincourt without
being distinguished from any of his knights; that he could take
his tradesmen&rsquo;s word for a thousand pounds, and need never
latch his garden gate; and that he did not fear molestation, in
wood or on moor, for his girl guests.&nbsp; Mr. Rawnsley,
however, found that a certain beauty had vanished which the
simple retirement of old valley days fifty years ago gave to the
men among whom Wordsworth lived.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
strangers,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;with their gifts of gold, their
vulgarity, and their requirements, <!-- page 169--><a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>have much
to answer for.&rsquo;&nbsp; As for their impressions of
Wordsworth, to understand them one must understand the vernacular
of the Lake District.&nbsp; &lsquo;What was Mr. Wordsworth like
in personal appearance?&rsquo; said Mr. Rawnsley once to an old
retainer, who still lives not far from Rydal Mount.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He was a ugly-fa&auml;ced man, and a
me&auml;n-liver,&rsquo; was the answer; but all that was really
meant was that he was a man of marked features, and led a very
simple life in matters of food and raiment.&nbsp; Another old
man, who believed that Wordsworth &lsquo;got most of his poetry
out of Hartley,&rsquo; spoke of the poet&rsquo;s wife as &lsquo;a
very onpleasant woman, very onpleasant indeed.&nbsp; A
close-fisted woman, that&rsquo;s what she was.&rsquo;&nbsp; This,
however, seems to have been merely a tribute to Mrs.
Wordsworth&rsquo;s admirable housekeeping qualities.</p>
<p>The first person interviewed by Mr. Rawnsley was an old lady
who had been once in service at Rydal Mount, and was, in 1870, a
lodging-house keeper at Grasmere.&nbsp; She was not a very
imaginative person, as may be gathered from the following
anecdote:&mdash;Mr. Rawnsley&rsquo;s sister came in from a late
evening walk, and said, &lsquo;O Mrs. D---, have you seen the
wonderful sunset?&rsquo;&nbsp; The good lady turned sharply round
and, drawing herself to her full height, as if mortally offended,
answered: &lsquo;No, miss; I&rsquo;m a tidy cook, I know, and
&ldquo;they say&rdquo; a decentish body for a landlady, but I
don&rsquo;t knaw nothing about sunsets or them sort of things,
they&rsquo;ve never been in my line.&rsquo;&nbsp; Her
reminiscence of Wordsworth was as worthy of tradition as it was
explanatory, from her point of view, of the method in which
Wordsworth composed, and was helped in his labours by his
enthusiastic sister.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, you know,&rsquo; she
said, &lsquo;Mr. Wordsworth went humming <!-- page 170--><a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>and booing
about, and she, Miss Dorothy, kept close behint him, and she
picked up the bits as he let &rsquo;em fall, and tak&rsquo;
&rsquo;em down, and put &rsquo;em together on paper for
him.&nbsp; And you may be very well sure as how she didn&rsquo;t
understand nor make sense out of &rsquo;em, and I doubt that he
didn&rsquo;t know much about them either himself, but, howivver,
there&rsquo;s a great many folk as do, I dare say.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Of Wordsworth&rsquo;s habit of talking to himself, and composing
aloud, we hear a great deal.&nbsp; &lsquo;Was Mr. Wordsworth a
sociable man?&rsquo; asked Mr. Rawnsley of a Rydal farmer.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Wudsworth, for a&rsquo; he had noa pride nor nowt,&rsquo;
was the answer, &lsquo;was a man who was quite one to hissel, ye
kna.&nbsp; He was not a man as folks could crack wi&rsquo;, nor
not a man as could crack wi&rsquo; folks.&nbsp; But there was
another thing as kep&rsquo; folk off, he had a ter&rsquo;ble girt
deep voice, and ye might see his faace agaan for long
enuff.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve knoan folks, village lads and lasses,
coming over by old road above, which runs from Grasmere to Rydal,
flayt a&rsquo;most to death there by Wishing Gaate to hear the
girt voice a groanin&rsquo; and mutterin&rsquo; and
thunderin&rsquo; of a still evening.&nbsp; And he had a way of
standin&rsquo; quite still by the rock there in t&rsquo; path
under Rydal, and folks could hear sounds like a wild beast coming
from the rocks, and childer were scared fit to be dead
a&rsquo;most.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Wordsworth&rsquo;s description of himself constantly recurs to
one:</p>
<blockquote><p>And who is he with modest looks,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And clad in sober russet gown?<br />
He murmurs by the running brooks,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A music sweeter than their own;<br />
He is retired as noontide dew,<br />
Or fountain in a noonday grove.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the corroboration comes in strange guise.&nbsp; Mr.
Rawnsley asked one of the Dalesmen about Wordsworth&rsquo;s <!--
page 171--><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>dress and habits.&nbsp; This was the reply:
&lsquo;Wudsworth wore a Jem Crow, never seed him in a boxer in my
life,&mdash;a Jem Crow and an old blue cloak was his rig, and
<i>as for his habits</i>, <i>he had noan</i>; niver knew him with
a pot i&rsquo; his hand, or a pipe i&rsquo; his mouth.&nbsp; But
he was a gre&auml;t skater, for a&rsquo; that&mdash;noan better
in these parts&mdash;why, he could cut his own na&auml;me
upo&rsquo; the ice, could Mr. Wudsworth.&rsquo;&nbsp; Skating
seems to have been Wordsworth&rsquo;s one form of
amusement.&nbsp; He was &lsquo;over feckless i&rsquo; his
hands&rsquo;&mdash;could not drive or ride&mdash;&lsquo;not a bit
of fish in him,&rsquo; and &lsquo;nowt of a
mountaineer.&rsquo;&nbsp; But he could skate.&nbsp; The rapture
of the time when, as a boy, on Esthwaite&rsquo;s frozen lake, he
had</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wheeled
about,<br />
Proud and exulting like an untired horse<br />
That cares not for his home, and, shod with steel,<br />
Had hissed along the polished ice,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>was continued, Mr. Rawnsley tells us, into manhood&rsquo;s
later day; and Mr. Rawnsley found many proofs that the skill the
poet had gained, when</p>
<blockquote><p>Not seldom from the uproar he retired,<br />
Into a silent bay, or sportively<br />
Glanced sideways, leaving the tumultuous throng<br />
To cut across the reflex of a star,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>was of such a kind as to astonish the natives among whom he
dwelt.&nbsp; The recollection of a fall he once had, when his
skate caught on a stone, still lingers in the district.&nbsp; A
boy had been sent to sweep the snow from the White Moss Tarn for
him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Did Mr. Wudsworth gie ye owt?&rsquo; he was
asked, when he returned from his labour.&nbsp; &lsquo;Na, but I
seed him tumlle, though!&rsquo; was the answer.&nbsp; &lsquo;He
was a ter&rsquo;ble girt skater, was Wudsworth now,&rsquo; says
one of Mr. Rawnsley&rsquo;s informants; &lsquo;he would put one
hand i&rsquo; his breast (he wore a frill shirt i&rsquo; them
days), <!-- page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>and t&rsquo; other hand i&rsquo; his
waistband, same as shepherds does to keep their hands warm, and
he would stand up straight and sway and swing away
grandly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Of his poetry they did not think much, and whatever was good
in it they ascribed to his wife, his sister, and Hartley
Coleridge.&nbsp; He wrote poetry, they said, &lsquo;because he
couldn&rsquo;t help it&mdash;because it was his
hobby&rsquo;&mdash;for sheer love, and not for money.&nbsp; They
could not understand his doing work &lsquo;for nowt,&rsquo; and
held his occupation in somewhat light esteem because it did not
bring in &lsquo;a deal o&rsquo; brass to the pocket.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Did you ever read his poetry, or see any books about in
the farmhouses?&rsquo; asked Mr. Rawnsley.&nbsp; The answer was
curious: &lsquo;Ay, ay, time or two.&nbsp; But ya&rsquo;re weel
aware there&rsquo;s potry and potry.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s potry
wi&rsquo; a li&rsquo;le bit pleasant in it, and potry sic as a
man can laugh at or the childer understand, and some as takes a
deal of mastery to make out what&rsquo;s said, and a deal of
Wudsworth&rsquo;s was this sort, ye kna.&nbsp; You could tell fra
the man&rsquo;s faace his potry would niver have no laugh in
it.&nbsp; His potry was quite different work from li&rsquo;le
Hartley.&nbsp; Hartley &rsquo;ud goa running along beside
o&rsquo; the brooks and mak his, and goa in the first oppen door
and write what he had got upo&rsquo; paper.&nbsp; But
Wudsworth&rsquo;s potry was real hard stuff, and bided a deal of
makking, and he&rsquo;d keep it in his head for long
enough.&nbsp; Eh, but it&rsquo;s queer, mon, different ways folks
hes of making potry now. . . .&nbsp; Not but what Mr. Wudsworth
didn&rsquo;t stand very high, and was a well-spoken man
enough.&rsquo;&nbsp; The best criticism on Wordsworth that Mr.
Rawnsley heard was this: &lsquo;He was an open-air man, and a
great critic of trees.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There are many useful and well-written essays in Professor
Knight&rsquo;s volume, but Mr. Rawnsley&rsquo;s is <!-- page

<h2>MR. SWINBURNE&rsquo;S <i>POEMS AND BALLADS</i> (<span
class="smcap">third series</span>)<br />
(<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, June 27, 1889.)</h2>
<p>Mr. Swinburne once set his age on fire by a volume of very
perfect and very poisonous poetry.&nbsp; Then he became
revolutionary and pantheistic, and cried out against those that
sit in high places both in heaven and on earth.&nbsp; Then he
invented Marie Stuart and laid upon us the heavy burden of
<i>Bothwell</i>.&nbsp; Then he retired to the nursery and wrote
poems about children of a somewhat over-subtle character.&nbsp;
He is now extremely patriotic, and manages to combine with his
patriotism a strong affection for the Tory party.&nbsp; He has
always been a great poet.&nbsp; But he has his limitations, the
chief of which is, curiously enough, the entire lack of any sense
of limit.&nbsp; His song is nearly always too loud for his
subject.&nbsp; His magnificent rhetoric, nowhere more magnificent
than in the volume that now lies before us, conceals rather than
reveals.&nbsp; It has been said of him, and with truth, that he
is a master of language, but with still greater truth it may be
said that Language is his master.&nbsp; Words seem to dominate
him.&nbsp; Alliteration tyrannizes over him.&nbsp; <!-- page
174--><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>Mere sound often becomes his lord.&nbsp; He is so
eloquent that whatever he touches becomes unreal.</p>
<p>Let us turn to the poem on the Armada:</p>
<blockquote><p>The wings of the south-west wind are widened; the
breath of his fervent lips,<br />
More keen than a sword&rsquo;s edge, fiercer than fire, falls
full on the plunging ships.<br />
The pilot is he of the northward flight, their stay and their
steersman he;<br />
A helmsman clothed with the tempest, and girdled with strength to
constrain the sea.<br />
And the host of them trembles and quails, caught fast in his hand
as a bird in the toils:<br />
For the wrath and the joy that fulfil him are mightier than
man&rsquo;s, whom he slays and spoils.<br />
And vainly, with heart divided in sunder, and labour of wavering
will,<br />
The lord of their host takes counsel with hope if haply their
star shine still.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Somehow we seem to have heard all this before.&nbsp; Does it
come from the fact that of all the poets who ever lived Mr.
Swinburne is the one who is the most limited in imagery?&nbsp; It
must be admitted that he is so.&nbsp; He has wearied us with his
monotony.&nbsp; &lsquo;Fire&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Sea&rsquo; are
the two words ever on his lips.&nbsp; We must confess also that
this shrill singing&mdash;marvellous as it is&mdash;leaves us out
of breath.&nbsp; Here is a passage from a poem called <i>A Word
with the Wind</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Be the sunshine bared or veiled, the sky superb or
shrouded,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Still the waters, lax and languid, chafed and
foiled,<br />
Keen and thwarted, pale and patient, clothed with fire or
clouded,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Vex their heart in vain, or sleep like serpents
coiled.<br />
Thee they look for, blind and baffled, wan with wrath and
weary,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Blown for ever back by winds that rock the bird:<br
/>
Winds that seamews breast subdue the sea, and bid the dreary<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Waves be weak as hearts made sick with hope
deferred.<br />
Let the clarion sound from westward, let the south bear token<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; How the glories of thy godhead sound and shine:<br
/>
Bid the land rejoice to see the land-wind&rsquo;s broad wings
broken,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bid the sea take comfort, bid the world be
thine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Verse of this kind may be justly praised for the sustained
strength and vigour of its metrical <!-- page 175--><a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>scheme.&nbsp; Its purely technical excellence is
extraordinary.&nbsp; But is it more than an oratorical <i>tour de
force</i>?&nbsp; Does it really convey much?&nbsp; Does it
charm?&nbsp; Could we return to it again and again with renewed
pleasure?&nbsp; We think not.&nbsp; It seems to us empty.</p>
<p>Of course, we must not look to these poems for any revelation
of human life.&nbsp; To be at one with the elements seems to be
Mr. Swinburne&rsquo;s aim.&nbsp; He seeks to speak with the
breath of wind and wave.&nbsp; The roar of the fire is ever in
his ears.&nbsp; He puts his clarion to the lips of Spring and
bids her blow, and the Earth wakes from her dreams and tells him
her secret.&nbsp; He is the first lyric poet who has tried to
make an absolute surrender of his own personality, and he has
succeeded.&nbsp; We hear the song, but we never know the
singer.&nbsp; We never even get near to him.&nbsp; Out of the
thunder and splendour of words he himself says nothing.&nbsp; We
have often had man&rsquo;s interpretation of Nature; now we have
Nature&rsquo;s interpretation of man, and she has curiously
little to say.&nbsp; Force and Freedom form her vague
message.&nbsp; She deafens us with her clangours.</p>
<p>But Mr. Swinburne is not always riding the whirlwind and
calling out of the depths of the sea.&nbsp; Romantic ballads in
Border dialect have not lost their fascination for him, and this
last volume contains some very splendid examples of this curious
artificial kind of poetry.&nbsp; The amount of pleasure one gets
out of dialect is a matter entirely of temperament.&nbsp; To say
&lsquo;mither&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;mother&rsquo; seems to
many the acme of romance.&nbsp; There are others who are not
quite so ready to believe in the pathos of provincialism.&nbsp;
There is, however, no doubt of Mr. Swinburne&rsquo;s mastery over
the form, whether the form be quite legitimate or not.&nbsp;
<i>The </i><!-- page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span><i>Weary Wedding</i> has the
concentration and colour of a great drama, and the quaintness of
its style lends it something of the power of a grotesque.&nbsp;
The ballad of <i>The Witch-Mother</i>, a medi&aelig;val Medea who
slays her children because her lord is faithless, is worth
reading on account of its horrible simplicity.&nbsp; <i>The
Bride&rsquo;s Tragedy</i>, with its strange refrain of</p>
<blockquote><p>In, in, out and in,<br />
Blaws the wind and whirls the whin:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <i>Jacobite&rsquo;s Exile</i>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>O lordly flow the Loire and Seine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And loud the dark Durance:<br />
But bonnier shine the braes of Tyne<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than a&rsquo; the fields of France;<br />
And the waves of Till that speak sae still<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Gleam goodlier where they glance:</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>The Tyneside Widow</i> and <i>A Reiver&rsquo;s
Neck-verse</i> are all poems of fine imaginative power, and some
of them are terrible in their fierce intensity of passion.&nbsp;
There is no danger of English poetry narrowing itself to a form
so limited as the romantic ballad in dialect.&nbsp; It is of too
vital a growth for that.&nbsp; So we may welcome Mr.
Swinburne&rsquo;s masterly experiments with the hope that things
which are inimitable will not be imitated.&nbsp; The collection
is completed by a few poems on children, some sonnets, a threnody
on John William Inchbold, and a lovely lyric entitled <i>The
Interpreters</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>In human thought have all things habitation;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our days<br />
Laugh, lower, and lighten past, and find no station<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That stays.</p>
<p>But thought and faith are mightier things than time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can wrong,<br />
Made splendid once by speech, or made sublime<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By song.</p>
<p><!-- page 177--><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>Remembrance, though the tide of change that rolls<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wax hoary,<br />
Gives earth and heaven, for song&rsquo;s sake and the
soul&rsquo;s,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their glory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Certainly, &lsquo;for song&rsquo;s sake&rsquo; we should love
Mr. Swinburne&rsquo;s work, cannot, indeed, help loving it, so
marvellous a music-maker is he.&nbsp; But what of the soul?&nbsp;
For the soul we must go elsewhere.</p>

Series.&nbsp; By Algernon Charles Swinburne.&nbsp; (Chatto and
Windus.)</p>
<h2>A CHINESE SAGE<br />
(<i>Speaker</i>, February 8, 1890.)</h2>
<p>An eminent Oxford theologian once remarked that his only
objection to modern progress was that it progressed forward
instead of backward&mdash;a view that so fascinated a certain
artistic undergraduate that he promptly wrote an essay upon some
unnoticed analogies between the development of ideas and the
movements of the common sea-crab.&nbsp; I feel sure the
<i>Speaker</i> will not be suspected even by its most
enthusiastic friends of holding this dangerous heresy of
retrogression.&nbsp; But I must candidly admit that I have come
to the conclusion that the most caustic criticism of modern life
I have met with for some time is that contained in the writings
of the learned Chuang Tz&#365;, recently translated into the
vulgar tongue by Mr. Herbert Giles, Her Majesty&rsquo;s Consul at
Tamsui.</p>
<p>The spread of popular education has no doubt made the name of
this great thinker quite familiar to the general public, but, for
the sake of the few and the over-cultured, I feel it my duty to
state <!-- page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>definitely who he was, and to give a
brief outline of the character of his philosophy.</p>
<p>Chuang Tz&#365;, whose name must carefully be pronounced as it
is not written, was born in the fourth century before Christ, by
the banks of the Yellow River, in the Flowery Land; and portraits
of the wonderful sage seated on the flying dragon of
contemplation may still be found on the simple tea-trays and
pleasing screens of many of our most respectable suburban
households.&nbsp; The honest ratepayer and his healthy family
have no doubt often mocked at the dome-like forehead of the
philosopher, and laughed over the strange perspective of the
landscape that lies beneath him.&nbsp; If they really knew who he
was, they would tremble.&nbsp; Chuang Tz&#365; spent his life in
preaching the great creed of Inaction, and in pointing out the
uselessness of all useful things.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do nothing, and
everything will be done,&rsquo; was the doctrine which he
inherited from his great master Lao Tz&#365;.&nbsp; To resolve
action into thought, and thought into abstraction, was his wicked
transcendental aim.&nbsp; Like the obscure philosopher of early
Greek speculation, he believed in the identity of contraries;
like Plato, he was an idealist, and had all the idealist&rsquo;s
contempt for utilitarian systems; he was a mystic like Dionysius,
and Scotus Erigena, and Jacob B&ouml;hme, and held, with them and
with Philo, that the object of life was to get rid of
self-consciousness, and to become the unconscious vehicle of a
higher illumination.&nbsp; In fact, Chuang Tz&#365; may be said
to have summed up in himself almost every mood of European
metaphysical or mystical thought, from Heraclitus down to
Hegel.&nbsp; There was something in him of the Quietist also; and
in his worship of Nothing he may be said to have in some measure
<!-- page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>anticipated those strange dreamers of medi&aelig;val
days who, like Tauler and Master Eckhart, adored the <i>purum
nihil</i> and the Abyss.&nbsp; The great middle classes of this
country, to whom, as we all know, our prosperity, if not our
civilization, is entirely due, may shrug their shoulders over all
this and ask, with a certain amount of reason, what is the
identity of contraries to them, and why they should get rid of
that self-consciousness which is their chief
characteristic.&nbsp; But Chuang Tz&#365; was something more than
a metaphysician and an illuminist.&nbsp; He sought to destroy
society, as we know it, as the middle classes know it; and the
sad thing is that he combines with the passionate eloquence of a
Rousseau the scientific reasoning of a Herbert Spencer.&nbsp;
There is nothing of the sentimentalist in him.&nbsp; He pities
the rich more than the poor, if he even pities at all, and
prosperity seems to him as tragic a thing as suffering.&nbsp; He
has nothing of the modern sympathy with failures, nor does he
propose that the prizes should always be given on moral grounds
to those who come in last in the race.&nbsp; It is the race
itself that he objects to; and as for active sympathy, which has
become the profession of so many worthy people in our own day, he
thinks that trying to make others good is as silly an occupation
as &lsquo;beating a drum in a forest in order to find a
fugitive.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is a mere waste of energy.&nbsp; That
is all.&nbsp; While, as for a thoroughly sympathetic man, he is,
in the eyes of Chuang Tz&#365;, simply a man who is always trying
to be somebody else, and so misses the only possible excuse for
his own existence.</p>
<p>Yes; incredible as it may seem, this curious thinker looked
back with a sigh of regret to a certain Golden Age when there
were no competitive examinations, no wearisome educational
systems, <!-- page 180--><a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>no missionaries, no penny dinners
for the people, no Established Churches, no Humanitarian
Societies, no dull lectures about one&rsquo;s duty to one&rsquo;s
neighbour, and no tedious sermons about any subject at all.&nbsp;
In those ideal days, he tells us, people loved each other without
being conscious of charity, or writing to the newspapers about
it.&nbsp; They were upright, and yet they never published books
upon Altruism.&nbsp; As every man kept his knowledge to himself,
the world escaped the curse of scepticism; and as every man kept
his virtues to himself, nobody meddled in other people&rsquo;s
business.&nbsp; They lived simple and peaceful lives, and were
contented with such food and raiment as they could get.&nbsp;
Neighbouring districts were in sight, and &lsquo;the cocks and
dogs of one could be heard in the other,&rsquo; yet the people
grew old and died without ever interchanging visits.&nbsp; There
was no chattering about clever men, and no laudation of good
men.&nbsp; The intolerable sense of obligation was unknown.&nbsp;
The deeds of humanity left no trace, and their affairs were not
made a burden for prosperity by foolish historians.</p>
<p>In an evil moment the Philanthropist made his appearance, and
brought with him the mischievous idea of Government.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There is such a thing,&rsquo; says Chuang Tz&#365;,
&lsquo;as leaving mankind alone: there has never been such a
thing as governing mankind.&rsquo;&nbsp; All modes of government
are wrong.&nbsp; They are unscientific, because they seek to
alter the natural environment of man; they are immoral because,
by interfering with the individual, they produce the most
aggressive forms of egotism; they are ignorant, because they try
to spread education; they are self-destructive, because they
engender anarchy.&nbsp; &lsquo;Of old,&rsquo; he tells us,
&lsquo;the Yellow Emperor first caused charity and duty to
one&rsquo;s neighbour to interfere <!-- page 181--><a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>with the
natural goodness of the heart of man.&nbsp; In consequence of
this, Yao and Shun wore the hair off their legs in endeavouring
to feed their people.&nbsp; They disturbed their internal economy
in order to find room for artificial virtues.&nbsp; They
exhausted their energies in framing laws, and they were
failures.&rsquo;&nbsp; Man&rsquo;s heart, our philosopher goes on
to say, may be &lsquo;forced down or stirred up,&rsquo; and in
either case the issue is fatal.&nbsp; Yao made the people too
happy, so they were not satisfied.&nbsp; Chieh made them too
wretched, so they grew discontented.&nbsp; Then every one began
to argue about the best way of tinkering up society.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is quite clear that something must be done,&rsquo; they
said to each other, and there was a general rush for
knowledge.&nbsp; The results were so dreadful that the Government
of the day had to bring in Coercion, and as a consequence of this
&lsquo;virtuous men sought refuge in mountain caves, while rulers
of state sat trembling in ancestral halls.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then,
when everything was in a state of perfect chaos, the Social
Reformers got up on platforms, and preached salvation from the
ills that they and their system had caused.&nbsp; The poor Social
Reformers!&nbsp; &lsquo;They know not shame, nor what it is to
blush,&rsquo; is the verdict of Chuang Tz&#365; upon them.</p>
<p>The economic question, also, is discussed by this almond-eyed
sage at great length, and he writes about the curse of capital as
eloquently as Mr. Hyndman.&nbsp; The accumulation of wealth is to
him the origin of evil.&nbsp; It makes the strong violent, and
the weak dishonest.&nbsp; It creates the petty thief, and puts
him in a bamboo cage.&nbsp; It creates the big thief, and sets
him on a throne of white jade.&nbsp; It is the father of
competition, and competition is the waste, as well as the
destruction, of energy.&nbsp; The order of <!-- page 182--><a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>nature is
rest, repetition, and peace.&nbsp; Weariness and war are the
results of an artificial society based upon capital; and the
richer this society gets, the more thoroughly bankrupt it really
is, for it has neither sufficient rewards for the good nor
sufficient punishments for the wicked.&nbsp; There is also this
to be remembered&mdash;that the prizes of the world degrade a man
as much as the world&rsquo;s punishments.&nbsp; The age is rotten
with its worship of success.&nbsp; As for education, true wisdom
can neither be learnt nor taught.&nbsp; It is a spiritual state,
to which he who lives in harmony with nature attains.&nbsp;
Knowledge is shallow if we compare it with the extent of the
unknown, and only the unknowable is of value.&nbsp; Society
produces rogues, and education makes one rogue cleverer than
another.&nbsp; That is the only result of School Boards.&nbsp;
Besides, of what possible philosophic importance can education
be, when it serves simply to make each man differ from his
neighbour?&nbsp; We arrive ultimately at a chaos of opinions,
doubt everything, and fall into the vulgar habit of arguing; and
it is only the intellectually lost who ever argue.&nbsp; Look at
Hui Tzu.&nbsp; &lsquo;He was a man of many ideas.&nbsp; His work
would fill five carts.&nbsp; But his doctrines were
paradoxical.&rsquo;&nbsp; He said that there were feathers in an
egg, because there were feathers on a chicken; that a dog could
be a sheep, because all names were arbitrary; that there was a
moment when a swift-flying arrow was neither moving nor at rest;
that if you took a stick a foot long, and cut it in half every
day, you would never come to the end of it; and that a bay horse
and a dun cow were three, because taken separately they were two,
and taken together they were one, and one and two made up
three.&nbsp; &lsquo;He was like a man running a race with his own
shadow, <!-- page 183--><a name="page183"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 183</span>and making a noise in order to drown
the echo.&nbsp; He was a clever gadfly, that was all.&nbsp; What
was the use of him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Morality is, of course, a different thing.&nbsp; It went out
of fashion, says Chuang Tz&#365;, when people began to
moralize.&nbsp; Men ceased then to be spontaneous and to act on
intuition.&nbsp; They became priggish and artificial, and were so
blind as to have a definite purpose in life.&nbsp; Then came
Governments and Philanthropists, those two pests of the
age.&nbsp; The former tried to coerce people into being good, and
so destroyed the natural goodness of man.&nbsp; The latter were a
set of aggressive busybodies who caused confusion wherever they
went.&nbsp; They were stupid enough to have principles, and
unfortunate enough to act up to them.&nbsp; They all came to bad
ends, and showed that universal altruism is as bad in its results
as universal egotism.&nbsp; &lsquo;They tripped people up over
charity, and fettered them with duties to their
neighbours.&rsquo;&nbsp; They gushed over music, and fussed over
ceremonies.&nbsp; As a consequence of all this, the world lost
its equilibrium, and has been staggering ever since.</p>
<p>Who, then, according to Chuang Tz&#365;, is the perfect
man?&nbsp; And what is his manner of life?&nbsp; The perfect man
does nothing beyond gazing at the universe.&nbsp; He adopts no
absolute position.&nbsp; &lsquo;In motion, he is like
water.&nbsp; At rest, he is like a mirror.&nbsp; And, like Echo,
he answers only when he is called upon.&rsquo;&nbsp; He lets
externals take care of themselves.&nbsp; Nothing material injures
him; nothing spiritual punishes him.&nbsp; His mental equilibrium
gives him the empire of the world.&nbsp; He is never the slave of
objective existences.&nbsp; He knows that, &lsquo;just as the
best language is that which is never spoken, so the best action
is that which is never <!-- page 184--><a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>done.&rsquo;&nbsp; He is passive, and accepts the laws
of life.&nbsp; He rests in inactivity, and sees the world become
virtuous of itself.&nbsp; He does not try to &lsquo;bring about
his own good deeds.&rsquo;&nbsp; He never wastes himself on
effort.&nbsp; He is not troubled about moral distinctions.&nbsp;
He knows that things are what they are, and that their
consequences will be what they will be.&nbsp; His mind is the
&lsquo;speculum of creation,&rsquo; and he is ever at peace.</p>
<p>All this is of course excessively dangerous, but we must
remember that Chuang Tz&#365; lived more than two thousand years
ago, and never had the opportunity of seeing our unrivalled
civilization.&nbsp; And yet it is possible that, were he to come
back to earth and visit us, he might have something to say to Mr.
Balfour about his coercion and active misgovernment in Ireland;
he might smile at some of our philanthropic ardours, and shake
his head over many of our organized charities; the School Board
might not impress him, nor our race for wealth stir his
admiration; he might wonder at our ideals, and grow sad over what
we have realized.&nbsp; Perhaps it is well that Chuang Tz&#365;
cannot return.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, thanks to Mr. Giles and Mr. Quaritch, we have his
book to console us, and certainly it is a most fascinating and
delightful volume.&nbsp; Chuang Tz&#365; is one of the Darwinians
before Darwin.&nbsp; He traces man from the germ, and sees his
unity with nature.&nbsp; As an anthropologist he is excessively
interesting, and he describes our primitive arboreal ancestor
living in trees through his terror of animals stronger than
himself, and knowing only one parent, the mother, with all the
accuracy of a lecturer at the Royal Society.&nbsp; Like Plato, he
adopts the dialogue as his mode of expression, &lsquo;putting
words into other people&rsquo;s mouths,&rsquo; <!-- page 185--><a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>he tells
us, &lsquo;in order to gain breadth of view.&rsquo;&nbsp; As a
story-teller he is charming.&nbsp; The account of the visit of
the respectable Confucius to the great Robber Ch&ecirc; is most
vivid and brilliant, and it is impossible not to laugh over the
ultimate discomfiture of the sage, the barrenness of whose moral
platitudes is ruthlessly exposed by the successful brigand.&nbsp;
Even in his metaphysics, Chuang Tz&#365; is intensely
humorous.&nbsp; He personifies his abstractions, and makes them
act plays before us.&nbsp; The Spirit of the Clouds, when passing
eastward through the expanse of air, happened to fall in with the
Vital Principle.&nbsp; The latter was slapping his ribs and
hopping about: whereupon the Spirit of the Clouds said,
&lsquo;Who are you, old man, and what are you doing?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Strolling!&rsquo; replied the Vital Principle, without
stopping, for all activities are ceaseless.&nbsp; &lsquo;I want
to <i>know</i> something,&rsquo; continued the Spirit of the
Clouds.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; cried the Vital Principle, in a
tone of disapprobation, and a marvellous conversation follows,
that is not unlike the dialogue between the Sphinx and the
Chimera in Flaubert&rsquo;s curious drama.&nbsp; Talking animals,
also, have their place in Chuang Tz&#365;&rsquo;s parables and
stories, and through myth and poetry and fancy his strange
philosophy finds musical utterance.</p>
<p>Of course it is sad to be told that it is immoral to be
consciously good, and that doing anything is the worst form of
idleness.&nbsp; Thousands of excellent and really earnest
philanthropists would be absolutely thrown upon the rates if we
adopted the view that nobody should be allowed to meddle in what
does not concern him.&nbsp; The doctrine of the uselessness of
all useful things would not merely endanger our commercial
supremacy as a nation, but might bring discredit upon many
prosperous and serious-minded <!-- page 186--><a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>members of
the shop-keeping classes.&nbsp; What would become of our popular
preachers, our Exeter Hall orators, our drawing-room evangelists,
if we said to them, in the words of Chuang Tz&#365;,
&lsquo;Mosquitoes will keep a man awake all night with their
biting, and just in the same way this talk of charity and duty to
one&rsquo;s neighbour drives us nearly crazy.&nbsp; Sirs, strive
to keep the world to its own original simplicity, and, as the
wind bloweth where it listeth, so let Virtue establish
itself.&nbsp; Wherefore this undue energy?&rsquo;&nbsp; And what
would be the fate of governments and professional politicians if
we came to the conclusion that there is no such thing as
governing mankind at all?&nbsp; It is clear that Chuang Tz&#365;
is a very dangerous writer, and the publication of his book in
English, two thousand years after his death, is obviously
premature, and may cause a great deal of pain to many thoroughly
respectable and industrious persons.&nbsp; It may be true that
the ideal of self-culture and self-development, which is the aim
of his scheme of life, and the basis of his scheme of philosophy,
is an ideal somewhat needed by an age like ours, in which most
people are so anxious to educate their neighbours that they have
actually no time left in which to educate themselves.&nbsp; But
would it be wise to say so?&nbsp; It seems to me that if we once
admitted the force of any one of Chuang Tz&#365;&rsquo;s
destructive criticisms we should have to put some check on our
national habit of self-glorification; and the only thing that
ever consoles man for the stupid things he does is the praise he
always gives himself for doing them.&nbsp; There may, however, be
a few who have grown wearied of that strange modern tendency that
sets enthusiasm to do the work of the intellect.&nbsp; To these,
and such as these, Chuang Tz&#365; will be <!-- page 187--><a

them not talk about him.&nbsp; He would be disturbing at
dinner-parties, and impossible at afternoon teas, and his whole
life was a protest against platform speaking.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
perfect man ignores self; the divine man ignores action; the true
sage ignores reputation.&rsquo;&nbsp; These are the principles of
Chuang Tz&#365;.</p>

<h2>MR. PATER&rsquo;S <i>APPRECIATIONS</i><br />
(<i>Speaker</i>, March 22, 1890.)</h2>
<p>When I first had the privilege&mdash;and I count it a very
high one&mdash;of meeting Mr. Walter Pater, he said to me,
smiling, &lsquo;Why do you always write poetry?&nbsp; Why do you
not write prose?&nbsp; Prose is so much more
difficult.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was during my undergraduate days at Oxford; days of lyrical
ardour and of studious sonnet-writing; days when one loved the
exquisite intricacy and musical repetitions of the ballade, and
the villanelle with its linked long-drawn echoes and its curious
completeness; days when one solemnly sought to discover the
proper temper in which a triolet should be written; delightful
days, in which, I am glad to say, there was far more rhyme than
reason.</p>
<p>I may frankly confess now that at the time I did not quite
comprehend what Mr. Pater really meant; and it was not till I had
carefully studied his beautiful and suggestive essays on the
Renaissance that I fully realized what a wonderful self-conscious
art the art of English prose-writing really is, or may be <!--
page 188--><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>made to be.&nbsp; Carlyle&rsquo;s stormy rhetoric,
Ruskin&rsquo;s winged and passionate eloquence, had seemed to me
to spring from enthusiasm rather than from art.&nbsp; I do not
think I knew then that even prophets correct their proofs.&nbsp;
As for Jacobean prose, I thought it too exuberant; and Queen Anne
prose appeared to me terribly bald, and irritatingly
rational.&nbsp; But Mr. Pater&rsquo;s essays became to me
&lsquo;the golden book of spirit and sense, the holy writ of
beauty.&rsquo;&nbsp; They are still this to me.&nbsp; It is
possible, of course, that I may exaggerate about them.&nbsp; I
certainly hope that I do; for where there is no exaggeration
there is no love, and where there is no love there is no
understanding.&nbsp; It is only about things that do not interest
one, that one can give a really unbiassed opinion; and this is no
doubt the reason why an unbiassed opinion is always
valueless.</p>
<p>But I must not allow this brief notice of Mr. Pater&rsquo;s
new volume to degenerate into an autobiography.&nbsp; I remember
being told in America that whenever Margaret Fuller wrote an
essay upon Emerson the printers had always to send out to borrow
some additional capital &lsquo;I&rsquo;s,&rsquo; and I feel it
right to accept this transatlantic warning.</p>
<p><i>Appreciations</i>, in the fine Latin sense of the word, is
the title given by Mr. Pater to his book, which is an exquisite
collection of exquisite essays, of delicately wrought works of
art&mdash;some of them being almost Greek in their purity of
outline and perfection of form, others medi&aelig;val in their
strangeness of colour and passionate suggestion, and all of them
absolutely modern, in the true meaning of the term
modernity.&nbsp; For he to whom the present is the only thing
that is present, knows nothing of the age in which he
lives.&nbsp; To realize the nineteenth century one must realize
every century that has preceded it, <!-- page 189--><a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>and that
has contributed to its making.&nbsp; To know anything about
oneself, one must know all about others.&nbsp; There must be no
mood with which one cannot sympathize, no dead mode of life that
one cannot make alive.&nbsp; The legacies of heredity may make us
alter our views of moral responsibility, but they cannot but
intensify our sense of the value of Criticism; for the true
critic is he who bears within himself the dreams and ideas and
feelings of myriad generations, and to whom no form of thought is
alien, no emotional impulse obscure.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most interesting, and certainly the least
successful, of the essays contained in the present volume is that
on <i>Style</i>.&nbsp; It is the most interesting because it is
the work of one who speaks with the high authority that comes
from the noble realization of things nobly conceived.&nbsp; It is
the least successful, because the subject is too abstract.&nbsp;
A true artist like Mr. Pater is most felicitous when he deals
with the concrete, whose very limitations give him finer freedom,
while they necessitate more intense vision.&nbsp; And yet what a
high ideal is contained in these few pages!&nbsp; How good it is
for us, in these days of popular education and facile journalism,
to be reminded of the real scholarship that is essential to the
perfect writer, who, &lsquo;being a true lover of words for their
own sake, a minute and constant observer of their
physiognomy,&rsquo; will avoid what is mere rhetoric, or
ostentatious ornament, or negligent misuse of terms, or
ineffective surplusage, and will be known by his tact of
omission, by his skilful economy of means, by his selection and
self-restraint, and perhaps above all by that conscious artistic
structure which is the expression of mind in style.&nbsp; I think
I have been wrong in saying that the subject is too
abstract.&nbsp; In Mr. Pater&rsquo;s hands it <!-- page 190--><a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>becomes
very real to us indeed, and he shows us how, behind the
perfection of a man&rsquo;s style, must lie the passion of a
man&rsquo;s soul.</p>
<p>As one passes to the rest of the volume, one finds essays on
Wordsworth and on Coleridge, on Charles Lamb and on Sir Thomas
Browne, on some of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays and on the English
kings that Shakespeare fashioned, on Dante Rossetti, and on
William Morris.&nbsp; As that on Wordsworth seems to be Mr.
Pater&rsquo;s last work, so that on the singer of the <i>Defence
of Guenevere</i> is certainly his earliest, or almost his
earliest, and it is interesting to mark the change that has taken
place in his style.&nbsp; This change is, perhaps, at first sight
not very apparent.&nbsp; In 1868 we find Mr. Pater writing with
the same exquisite care for words, with the same studied music,
with the same temper, and something of the same mode of
treatment.&nbsp; But, as he goes on, the architecture of the
style becomes richer and more complex, the epithet more precise
and intellectual.&nbsp; Occasionally one may be inclined to think
that there is, here and there, a sentence which is somewhat long,
and possibly, if one may venture to say so, a little heavy and
cumbersome in movement.&nbsp; But if this be so, it comes from
those side-issues suddenly suggested by the idea in its progress,
and really revealing the idea more perfectly; or from those
felicitous after-thoughts that give a fuller completeness to the
central scheme, and yet convey something of the charm of chance;
or from a desire to suggest the secondary shades of meaning with
all their accumulating effect, and to avoid, it may be, the
violence and harshness of too definite and exclusive an
opinion.&nbsp; For in matters of art, at any rate, thought is
inevitably coloured by emotion, and so is fluid rather than
fixed, and, recognizing its dependence <!-- page 191--><a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>upon the
moods and upon the passion of fine moments, will not accept the
rigidity of a scientific formula or a theological dogma.&nbsp;
The critical pleasure, too, that we receive from tracing, through
what may seem the intricacies of a sentence, the working of the
constructive intelligence, must not be overlooked.&nbsp; As soon
as we have realized the design, everything appears clear and
simple.&nbsp; After a time, these long sentences of Mr.
Pater&rsquo;s come to have the charm of an elaborate piece of
music, and the unity of such music also.</p>
<p>I have suggested that the essay on Wordsworth is probably the
most recent bit of work contained in this volume.&nbsp; If one
might choose between so much that is good, I should be inclined
to say it is the finest also.&nbsp; The essay on Lamb is
curiously suggestive; suggestive, indeed, of a somewhat more
tragic, more sombre figure, than men have been wont to think of
in connection with the author of the <i>Essays of Elia</i>.&nbsp;
It is an interesting aspect under which to regard Lamb, but
perhaps he himself would have had some difficulty in recognizing
the portrait given of him.&nbsp; He had, undoubtedly, great
sorrows, or motives for sorrow, but he could console himself at a
moment&rsquo;s notice for the real tragedies of life by reading
any one of the Elizabethan tragedies, provided it was in a folio
edition.&nbsp; The essay on Sir Thomas Browne is delightful, and
has the strange, personal, fanciful charm of the author of the
<i>Religio Medici</i>, Mr. Pater often catching the colour and
accent and tone of whatever artist, or work of art, he deals
with.&nbsp; That on Coleridge, with its insistence on the
necessity of the cultivation of the relative, as opposed to the
absolute spirit in philosophy and in ethics, and its high
appreciation of the poet&rsquo;s true position in our literature,
is in <!-- page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>style and substance a very blameless
work.&nbsp; Grace of expression and delicate subtlety of thought
and phrase, characterize the essays on Shakespeare.&nbsp; But the
essay on Wordsworth has a spiritual beauty of its own.&nbsp; It
appeals, not to the ordinary Wordsworthian with his uncritical
temper, and his gross confusion of ethical and &aelig;sthetical
problems, but rather to those who desire to separate the gold
from the dross, and to reach at the true Wordsworth through the
mass of tedious and prosaic work that bears his name, and that
serves often to conceal him from us.&nbsp; The presence of an
alien element in Wordsworth&rsquo;s art is, of course, recognized
by Mr. Pater, but he touches on it merely from the psychological
point of view, pointing out how this quality of higher and lower
moods gives the effect in his poetry &lsquo;of a power not
altogether his own, or under his control&rsquo;; a power which
comes and goes when it wills, &lsquo;so that the old fancy which
made the poet&rsquo;s art an enthusiasm, a form of divine
possession, seems almost true of him.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr.
Pater&rsquo;s earlier essays had their <i>purpurei panni</i>, so
eminently suitable for quotation, such as the famous passage on
<i>Mona Lisa</i>, and that other in which Botticelli&rsquo;s
strange conception of the Virgin is so strangely set forth.&nbsp;
From the present volume it is difficult to select any one passage
in preference to another as specially characteristic of Mr.
Pater&rsquo;s treatment.&nbsp; This, however, is worth quoting at
length.&nbsp; It contains a truth eminently suitable for our
age:</p>
<blockquote><p>That the end of life is not action but
contemplation&mdash;<i>being</i> as distinct from
<i>doing</i>&mdash;a certain disposition of the mind: is, in some
shape or other, the principle of all the higher morality.&nbsp;
In poetry, in art, if you enter into their true spirit at all,
you touch this principle in a measure; these, by their sterility,
are a type of beholding for the <!-- page 193--><a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>mere joy of
beholding.&nbsp; To treat life in the spirit of art is to make
life a thing in which means and ends are identified: to encourage
such treatment, the true moral significance of art and
poetry.&nbsp; Wordsworth, and other poets who have been like him
in ancient or more recent times, are the masters, the experts, in
this art of impassioned contemplation.&nbsp; Their work is not to
teach lessons, or enforce rules, or even to stimulate us to noble
ends, but to withdraw the thoughts for a while from the mere
machinery of life, to fix them, with appropriate emotions, on the
spectacle of those great facts in man&rsquo;s existence which no
machinery affects, &lsquo;on the great and universal passions of
men, the most general and interesting of their occupations, and
the entire world of nature&rsquo;&mdash;on &lsquo;the operations
of the elements and the appearances of the visible universe, on
storm and sunshine, on the revolutions of the seasons, on cold
and heat, on loss of friends and kindred, on injuries and
resentments, on gratitude and hope, on fear and
sorrow.&rsquo;&nbsp; To witness this spectacle with appropriate
emotions is the aim of all culture; and of these emotions poetry
like Wordsworth&rsquo;s is a great nourisher and stimulant.&nbsp;
He sees nature full of sentiment and excitement; he sees men and
women as parts of nature, passionate, excited, in strange
grouping and connection with the grandeur and beauty of the
natural world:&mdash;images, in his own words, &lsquo;of men
suffering; amid awful forms and powers.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Certainly the real secret of Wordsworth has never been better
expressed.&nbsp; After having read and reread Mr. Pater&rsquo;s
essay&mdash;for it requires re-reading&mdash;one returns to the
poet&rsquo;s work with a new sense of joy and wonder, and with
something of eager and impassioned expectation.&nbsp; And perhaps
this might be roughly taken as the test or touchstone of the
finest criticism.</p>
<p>Finally, one cannot help noticing the delicate instinct that
has gone to fashion the brief epilogue that ends this delightful
volume.&nbsp; The difference between the classical and romantic
spirits in art has <!-- page 194--><a name="page194"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 194</span>often, and with much over-emphasis,
been discussed.&nbsp; But with what a light sure touch does Mr.
Pater write of it!&nbsp; How subtle and certain are his
distinctions!&nbsp; If imaginative prose be really the special
art of this century, Mr. Pater must rank amongst our
century&rsquo;s most characteristic artists.&nbsp; In certain
things he stands almost alone.&nbsp; The age has produced
wonderful prose styles, turbid with individualism, and violent
with excess of rhetoric.&nbsp; But in Mr. Pater, as in Cardinal
Newman, we find the union of personality with perfection.&nbsp;
He has no rival in his own sphere, and he has escaped
disciples.&nbsp; And this, not because he has not been imitated,
but because in art so fine as his there is something that, in its
essence, is inimitable.</p>

<p>Perhaps he will write poetry some day.&nbsp; If he does we
would earnestly appeal to him to give up calling a cock
&lsquo;proud chanticleer.&rsquo;&nbsp; Few synonyms are so
depressing.</p>
<p>A young writer can gain more from the study of a literary poet
than from the study of a lyrist.</p>
<p>I have seen many audiences more interesting than the actors,
and have often heard better dialogue in the <i>foyer</i> than I
have on the stage.</p>
<p>The Dramatic College might take up the education of spectators
as well as that of players, and <!-- page 195--><a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>teach
people that there is a proper moment for the throwing of flowers
as well as a proper method.</p>
<p>Life remains eternally unchanged; it is art which, by
presenting it to us under various forms, enables us to realize
its many-sided mysteries, and to catch the quality of its most
fiery-coloured moments.&nbsp; The originality, I mean, which we
ask from the artist, is originality of treatment, not of
subject.&nbsp; It is only the unimaginative who ever
invents.&nbsp; The true artist is known by the use he makes of
what he annexes, and he annexes everything.</p>
<p>If I ventured on a bit of advice, which I feel most reluctant
to do, it would be to the effect that while one should always
study the method of a great artist, one should never imitate his
manner.&nbsp; The manner of an artist is essentially individual,
the method of an artist is absolutely universal.&nbsp; The first
is personality, which no one should copy; the second is
perfection, which all should aim at.</p>
<p>A critic who posed as an authority on field sports assured me
that no one ever went out hunting when roses were in full
bloom.&nbsp; Personally, that is exactly the season I would
select for the chase, but then I know more about flowers than I
do about foxes, and like them much better.</p>
<p>The nineteenth century may be a prosaic age, but we fear that,
if we are to judge by the general run of novels, it is not an age
of prose.</p>
<p>Perhaps in this century we are too altruistic to be really
artistic.</p>
<p>I am led to hope that the University will some day have a
theatre of its own, and that proficiency <!-- page 196--><a

scene-painting will be regarded as a necessary qualification for
the Slade Professorship.&nbsp; On the stage, literature returns
to life and arch&aelig;ology becomes art.&nbsp; A fine theatre is
a temple where all the muses may meet, a second Parnassus.</p>
<p>It would be sad indeed if the many volumes of poems that are
every year published in London found no readers but the authors
themselves and the authors&rsquo; relations; and the real
philanthropist should recognize it as part of his duties to buy
every new book of verse that appears.</p>
<p>A fifteen-line sonnet is as bad a monstrosity as a sonnet in
dialogue.</p>
<p>Antiquarian books, as a rule, are extremely dull
reading.&nbsp; They give us facts without form, science without

<p>The Roman patron, in fact, kept the Roman poet alive, and we
fancy that many of our modern bards rather regret the old
system.&nbsp; Better, surely, the humiliation of the
<i>sportula</i> than the indignity of a bill for printing!&nbsp;
Better to accept a country-house as a gift than to be in debt to
one&rsquo;s landlady!&nbsp; On the whole, the patron was an
excellent institution, if not for poetry at least for the poets;
. . . every poet longs for a M&aelig;cenas.</p>
<p>The two things the Greeks valued most in actors were grace of
gesture and music of voice.&nbsp; Indeed, to gain these virtues
their actors used to subject themselves to a regular course of
gymnastics and a particular regime of diet, health being to the
Greeks not merely a quality of art, but a condition of its
production.</p>

<p>Not that a tramp&rsquo;s mode of life is at all unsuited to
the development of the poetic faculty.&nbsp; Far from it!&nbsp;
He, if any one, should possess that freedom of mood which is so
essential to the artist, for he has no taxes to pay and no
relations to worry him.&nbsp; The man who possesses a permanent
address, and whose name is to be found in the Directory, is
necessarily limited and localized.&nbsp; Only the tramp has
absolute liberty of living.&nbsp; Was not Homer himself a
vagrant, and did not Thespis go about in a caravan?</p>
<p>In art as in life the law of heredity holds good.&nbsp; <i>On

<p>He has succeeded in studying a fine poet without stealing from

<p>Morocco is a sort of paradox among countries, for though it
lies westward of Piccadilly, yet it is purely Oriental in
character, and though it is but three hours&rsquo; sail from
Europe, yet it makes you feel (to use the forcible expression of
an American writer) as if you had been taken up by the scruff of
the neck and set down in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>As children themselves are the perfect flowers of life, so a
collection of the best poems written on children should be the
most perfect of all anthologies.</p>
<p><!-- page 198--><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>No English poet has written of children with more love
and grace and delicacy [than Herrick].&nbsp; His <i>Ode on the
Birth of Our Saviour</i>, his poem <i>To His Saviour</i>, <i>A
Child</i>: <i>A Present by a Child</i>, his <i>Graces for
Children</i>, and his many lovely epitaphs on children are all of
them exquisite works of art, simple, sweet and sincere.</p>
<p>As the cross-benches form a refuge for those who have no minds
to make up, so those who cannot make up their minds always take
to Homeric studies.&nbsp; Many of our leaders have sulked in
their tents with Achilles after some violent political crisis
and, enraged at the fickleness of fortune, more than one has
given up to poetry what was obviously meant for party.</p>
<p>There are two ways of misunderstanding a poem.&nbsp; One is to
misunderstand it and the other to praise it for qualities it does
not possess.</p>
<p>Most modern calendars mar the sweet simplicity of our lives by
reminding us that each day that passes is the anniversary of some
perfectly uninteresting event.&nbsp; It is true that such
aphorisms as</p>
<blockquote><p>Graves are a <i>mother&rsquo;s dimples</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we complain,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote><p>The primrose wears a constant smile,<br />
And captive takes the heart,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>can hardly be said to belong to the very highest order of
poetry, still, they are preferable, on the whole, to the date of
Hannah More&rsquo;s birth, or of the burning down of Exeter
Change, or of the opening of the Great Exhibition; and though it
<!-- page 199--><a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Culture, we should all be much improved if we began each day with
a fine passage of English poetry.</p>
<p>Even the most uninteresting poet cannot survive bad
editing.</p>
<p>Prefixed to the Calendar is an introductory note . . .
displaying that intimate acquaintance with Sappho&rsquo;s lost
poems which is the privilege only of those who are not acquainted
with Greek literature.</p>
<p>Mediocre critics are usually safe in their generalities; it is
in their reasons and examples that they come so lamentably to
grief.</p>
<p>All premature panegyrics bring their own punishment upon

<p>Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was one of the first true men of
letters America produced, and as such deserves a high place in
any history of American civilization.&nbsp; To a land out of
breath in its greed for gain he showed the example of a life
devoted entirely to the study of literature; his lectures, though
not by any means brilliant, were still productive of much good;
he had a most charming and gracious personality, and he wrote
some pretty poems.&nbsp; But his poems are not of the kind that
call for intellectual analysis or for elaborate description or,
indeed, for any serious discussion at all.</p>
<p>Though the <i>Psalm of Life</i> be shouted from Maine to

<p>Good novelists are much rarer than good sons, and none of us
would part readily with Micawber and Mrs. Nickleby.&nbsp; Still,
the fact remains that a man who was affectionate and loving to
his children, generous and warm-hearted to his friends, and whose
books are the very bacchanalia of benevolence, pilloried his
parents to make the groundlings laugh, and this fact every
biographer of Dickens should face and, if possible, explain.</p>

subject, and one that would fill a volume, but what we do know

<p>A pillar of fire to the few who knew him, and of cloud to the
many who knew him not, Dante Gabriel Rossetti lived apart from
the gossip and tittle-tattle of a shallow age.&nbsp; He never
trafficked with the merchants for his soul, nor brought his wares
into the market-place for the idle to gape at.&nbsp; Passionate
and romantic though he was, yet there was in his nature something
of high austerity.&nbsp; He loved seclusion, and hated notoriety,
and would have shuddered at the idea that within a few years
after his death he was to make his appearance in a series of
popular biographies, sandwiched between the author of
<i>Pickwick</i> and the Great Lexicographer.</p>

<p>We have no doubt that when Bailey wrote to Lord Houghton that
common-sense and gentleness were Keats&rsquo;s two special

Keats&rsquo;s charm as a man is his fascinating

<p>The Apostolic dictum, that women should not be suffered to
teach, is no longer applicable to a society such as ours, with
its solidarity of interests, its recognition of natural rights,
and its universal education, however suitable it may have been to
the Greek cities under Roman rule.&nbsp; Nothing in the United
States struck me more than the fact that the remarkable
intellectual progress of that country is very largely due to the
efforts of American women, who edit many of the most powerful
magazines and newspapers, take part in the discussion of every
question of public interest, and exercise an important influence
upon the growth and tendencies of literature and art.&nbsp;
Indeed, the women of America are the one class in the community
that enjoys that leisure which is so necessary for culture.&nbsp;
The men are, as a <!-- page 203--><a name="page203"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>rule, so absorbed in business, that
the task of bringing some element of form into the chaos of daily
life is left almost entirely to the opposite sex, and an eminent
Bostonian once assured me that in the twentieth century the whole
culture of his country would be in petticoats.&nbsp; By that
time, however, it is probable that the dress of the two sexes
will be assimilated, as similarity of costume always follows
similarity of pursuits.</p>
<p>The aim of social comedy, in Menander no less than in
Sheridan, is to mirror the manners, not to reform the morals, of
its day, and the censure of the Puritan, whether real or
affected, is always out of place in literary criticism, and shows
a want of recognition of the essential distinction between art
and life.&nbsp; After all, it is only the Philistine who thinks
of blaming Jack Absolute for his deception, Bob Acres for his
cowardice, and Charles Surface for his extravagance, and there is
very little use in airing one&rsquo;s moral sense at the expense
of one&rsquo;s artistic appreciation.</p>
<p>The <i>&AElig;neid</i> bears almost the same relation to the
<i>Iliad</i> that the <i>Idylls of the King</i> do to the old
Celtic romances of Arthur.&nbsp; Like them it is full of
felicitous modernisms, of exquisite literary echoes and of
delicate and delightful pictures; as Lord Tennyson loves England
so did Virgil love Rome; the pageants of history and the purple
of empire are equally dear to both poets; but neither of them has
the grand simplicity or the large humanity of the early singers,
and, as a hero, &AElig;neas is no less a failure than Arthur.</p>
<p>There is always a certain amount of danger in any attempt to
cultivate impossible virtues.</p>
<p><!-- page 204--><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>As far as the serious presentation of life is
concerned, what we require is more imaginative treatment, greater
freedom from theatric language and theatric convention.&nbsp; It
may be questioned, also, whether the consistent reward of virtue
and punishment of wickedness be really the healthiest ideal for
an art that claims to mirror nature.</p>
<p>True originality is to be found rather in the use made of a
model than in the rejection of all models and masters.&nbsp;
<i>Dans l&rsquo;art comme dans la nature on est toujours fils de
quelqu&rsquo;un</i>, and we should not quarrel with the reed if
it whispers to us the music of the lyre.&nbsp; A little child
once asked me if it was the nightingale who taught the linnets
how to sing.</p>
<p>In France they have had one great genius, Balzac, who invented
the modern method of looking at life; and one great artist,
Flaubert, who is the impeccable master of style; and to the
influence of these two men we may trace almost all contemporary
French fiction.&nbsp; But in England we have had no schools worth
speaking of.&nbsp; The fiery torch lit by the Bront&euml;s has
not been passed on to other hands; Dickens has influenced only
journalism; Thackeray&rsquo;s delightful superficial philosophy,
superb narrative power, and clever social satire have found no
echoes; nor has Trollope left any direct successors behind
him&mdash;a fact which is not much to be regretted, however, as,
admirable though Trollope undoubtedly is for rainy afternoons and
tedious railway journeys, from the point of view of literature he
is merely the perpetual curate of Pudlington Parva.</p>
<p>George Meredith&rsquo;s style is chaos illumined by brilliant
flashes of lightning.&nbsp; As a writer he has <!-- page 205--><a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>mastered
everything, except language; as a novelist he can do everything,
except tell a story; as an artist he is everything, except
articulate.&nbsp; Too strange to be popular, too individual to
have imitators, the author of <i>Richard Feverel</i> stands
absolutely alone.&nbsp; It is easy to disarm criticism, but he
has disarmed the disciple.&nbsp; He gives us his philosophy
through the medium of wit, and is never so pathetic as when he is
humorous.&nbsp; To turn truth into a paradox is not difficult,
but George Meredith makes all his paradoxes truths, and no
Theseus can thread his labyrinth, no &OElig;dipus solve his
secret.</p>
<p>The most perfect and the most poisonous of all modern French
poets once remarked that a man can live for three days without
bread, but that no one can live for three days without
poetry.&nbsp; This, however, can hardly be said to be a popular
view, or one that commends itself to that curiously uncommon
quality which is called common-sense.&nbsp; I fancy that most
people, if they do not actually prefer a salmis to a sonnet,
certainly like their culture to repose on a basis of good
cookery.</p>
<p>A cynical critic once remarked that no great poet is
intelligible and no little poet worth understanding, but that
otherwise poetry is an admirable thing.&nbsp; This, however,
seems to us a somewhat harsh view of the subject.&nbsp; Little
poets are an extremely interesting study.&nbsp; The best of them
have often some new beauty to show us, and though the worst of
them may bore yet they rarely brutalize.</p>
<p>It is a curious thing that when minor poets write choruses to
a play they should always consider it necessary to adopt the
style and language of a bad translator.&nbsp; We fear that Mr.
Bohn has much to answer for.</p>
<p><!-- page 206--><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>In one sonnet he makes a distinct attempt to be
original and the result is extremely depressing.</p>
<blockquote><p>Earth wears her grandest robe, by autumn spun,<br
/>
<i>Like some stout matron who of youth has run</i><br />
<i>The course</i>, . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is the most dreadful simile we have ever come across even in
poetry.&nbsp; Mr. Griffiths should beware of originality.&nbsp;
Like beauty, it is a fatal gift.</p>
<p>There is a wide difference between the beautiful Tuscan city
and the sea-city of the Adriatic.&nbsp; Florence is a city full
of memories of the great figures of the past.&nbsp; The traveller
cannot pass along her streets without treading in the very traces
of Dante, without stepping on soil made memorable by footprints
never to be effaced.&nbsp; The greatness of the surroundings, the
palaces, churches, and frowning medi&aelig;val castles in the
midst of the city, are all thrown into the background by the
greatness, the individuality, the living power and vigour of the
men who are their originators, and at the same time their
inspiring soul.&nbsp; But when we turn to Venice the effect is
very different.&nbsp; We do not think of the makers of that
marvellous city, but rather of what they made.&nbsp; The
idealized image of Venice herself meets us everywhere.&nbsp; The
mother is not overshadowed by the too great glory of any of her
sons.&nbsp; In her records the city is everything&mdash;the
republic, the worshipped ideal of a community in which every man
for the common glory seems to have been willing to sink his
own.&nbsp; We know that Dante stood within the red walls of the
arsenal, and saw the galleys making and mending, and the pitch
flaming up to heaven; Petrarch came to visit the great Mistress
of the Sea, taking refuge there, &lsquo;in <!-- page 207--><a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>this city,
true home of the human race,&rsquo; from trouble, war and
pestilence outside; and Byron, with his facile enthusiasms and
fervent eloquence, made his home for a time in one of the
stately, decaying palaces; but with these exceptions no great
poet has ever associated himself with the life of Venice.&nbsp;
She had architects, sculptors and painters, but no singer of her
own.</p>
<p>To realize the popularity of the great poets one should turn
to the minor poets and see whom they follow, what master they
select, whose music they echo.</p>
<p>Ordinary theology has long since converted its gold into lead,
and words and phrases that once touched the heart of the world
have become wearisome and meaningless through repetition.&nbsp;
If Theology desires to move us, she must re-write her
formulas.</p>
<p>It takes a great artist to be thoroughly modern.&nbsp; Nature
is always a little behind the age.</p>
<p>Mr. Nash, who styles himself &lsquo;a humble soldier in the
army of Faith,&rsquo; expresses a hope that his book may
&lsquo;invigorate devotional feeling, especially among the young,
to whom verse is perhaps more attractive than to their
elders,&rsquo; but we should be sorry to think that people of any
age could admire such a paraphrase as the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>Foxes have holes in which to slink for rest,<br />
The birds of air find shelter in the nest;<br />
But He, the Son of Man and Lord of all,<br />
Has no abiding place His own to call.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a curious fact that the worst work is always done with
the best intentions, and that people are <!-- page 208--><a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>never so
trivial as when they take themselves very seriously.</p>
<p>Mr. Foster is an American poet who has read Hawthorne, which
is wise of him, and imitated Longfellow, which is not quite so
commendable.</p>
<p><i>Andiatoroct&egrave;</i> is the title of a volume of poems
by the Rev. Clarence Walworth, of Albany, N.Y.&nbsp; It is a word
borrowed from the Indians, and should, we think, be returned to
them as soon as possible.&nbsp; The most curious poem of the book
is called <i>Scenes at the Holy Home</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus and Joseph at work!&nbsp;
Hurra!<br />
Sight never to see again,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A prentice Deity plies the saw,<br />
While the Master ploughs with the plane.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Poems of this kind were popular in the Middle Ages when the
cathedrals of every Christian country served as its
theatres.&nbsp; They are anachronisms now, and it is odd that
they should come to us from the United States.&nbsp; In matters
of this kind we should have some protection.</p>
<p>As for the triolets, and the rondels, and the careful study of
metrical subtleties, these things are merely the signs of a
desire for perfection in small things and of the recognition of
poetry as an art.&nbsp; They have had certainly one good
result&mdash;they have made our minor poets readable, and have
not left us entirely at the mercy of geniuses.</p>
<p>Poetry has many modes of music; she does not blow through one
pipe alone.&nbsp; Directness of utterance is good, but so is the
subtle recasting of thought into a new and delightful form.&nbsp;
Simplicity is good, but complexity, mystery, strangeness,
symbolism, <!-- page 209--><a name="page209"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 209</span>obscurity even, these have their
value.&nbsp; Indeed, properly speaking, there is no such thing as
Style; there are merely styles, that is all.</p>
<p>Writers of poetical prose are rarely good poets.</p>
<p>Poetry may be said to need far more self-restraint than
prose.&nbsp; Its conditions are more exquisite.&nbsp; It produces
its effects by more subtle means.&nbsp; It must not be allowed to
degenerate into mere rhetoric or mere eloquence.&nbsp; It is, in
one sense, the most self-conscious of all the arts, as it is
never a means to an end but always an end in itself.</p>
<p>It may be difficult for a poet to find English synonyms for
Asiatic expressions, but even if it were impossible it is none
the less a poet&rsquo;s duty to find them.&nbsp; As it is, Sir
Edwin Arnold has translated Sa&rsquo;di and some one must
translate Sir Edwin Arnold.</p>
<p>Lounging in the open air is not a bad school for poets, but it
largely depends on the lounger.</p>
<p>People are so fond of giving away what they do not want
themselves, that charity is largely on the increase.&nbsp; But
with this kind of charity I have not much sympathy.&nbsp; If one
gives away a book, it should be a charming book&mdash;so
charming, that one regrets having given it.</p>
<p>Mr. Whistler, for some reason or other, always adopted the
phraseology of the minor prophets.&nbsp; Possibly it was in order
to emphasize his well-known claims to verbal inspiration, or
perhaps he thought with Voltaire that <i>Habakkuk &eacute;tait
capable de tout</i>, and wished to shelter himself under the
shield of a definitely irresponsible writer none of whose
prophecies, according to the French philosopher, has <!-- page
210--><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>ever been fulfilled.&nbsp; The idea was clever enough
at the beginning, but ultimately the manner became
monotonous.&nbsp; The spirit of the Hebrews is excellent but
their mode of writing is not to be imitated, and no amount of
American jokes will give it that modernity which is essential to
a good literary style.&nbsp; Admirable as are Mr.
Whistler&rsquo;s fireworks on canvas, his fireworks in prose are
abrupt, violent and exaggerated.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The decisive events of the world,&rsquo; as has been
well said, &lsquo;take place in the intellect,&rsquo; and as for
Board-schools, academic ceremonies, hospital wards and the like,
they may be well left to the artists of the illustrated papers,
who do them admirably and quite as well as they need be
done.&nbsp; Indeed, the pictures of contemporary events, Royal
marriages, naval reviews and things of this kind that appear in
the Academy every year, are always extremely bad; while the very
same subjects treated in black and white in the <i>Graphic</i> or
the <i>London News</i> are excellent.&nbsp; Besides, if we want
to understand the history of a nation through the medium of art,
it is to the imaginative and ideal arts that we have to go and
not to the arts that are definitely imitative.&nbsp; The visible
aspect of life no longer contains for us the secret of
life&rsquo;s spirit.</p>
<p>The difficulty under which the novelists of our day labour
seems to me to be this: if they do not go into society, their
books are unreadable; and if they do go into society, they have
no time left for writing.</p>
<p>I must confess that most modern mysticism seems to me to be
simply a method of imparting useless knowledge in a form that no
one can understand.&nbsp; <!-- page 211--><a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>Allegory,
parable, and vision have their high artistic uses, but their
philosophical and scientific uses are very small.</p>
<p>The object of most modern fiction is not to give pleasure to
the artistic instinct, but rather to portray life vividly for us,
to draw attention to social anomalies, and social forms of
injustice.&nbsp; Many of our novelists are really pamphleteers,
reformers masquerading as story-tellers, earnest sociologists
seeking to mend as well as to mirror life.</p>
<p>The book is certainly characteristic of an age so practical
and so literary as ours, an age in which all social reforms have
been preceded and have been largely influenced by fiction.</p>
<p>Mr. Stopford Brooke said some time ago that Socialism and the
socialistic spirit would give our poets nobler and loftier themes
for song, would widen their sympathies and enlarge the horizon of
their vision, and would touch, with the fire and fervour of a new
faith, lips that had else been silent, hearts that but for this
fresh gospel had been cold.&nbsp; What Art gains from
contemporary events is always a fascinating problem and a problem
that is not easy to solve.&nbsp; It is, however, certain that
Socialism starts well equipped.&nbsp; She has her poets and her
painters, her art lecturers and her cunning designers, her
powerful orators and her clever writers.&nbsp; If she fails it
will not be for lack of expression.&nbsp; If she succeeds her
triumph will not be a triumph of mere brute force.</p>
<p>Socialism is not going to allow herself to be trammelled by
any hard and fast creed or to be <!-- page 212--><a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>stereotyped
into an iron formula.&nbsp; She welcomes many and multiform
natures.&nbsp; She rejects none and has room for all.&nbsp; She
has the attraction of a wonderful personality and touches the
heart of one and the brain of another, and draws this man by his
hatred and injustice, and his neighbour by his faith in the
future, and a third, it may be, by his love of art or by his wild
worship of a lost and buried past.&nbsp; And all of this is
well.&nbsp; For, to make men Socialists is nothing, but to make
Socialism human is a great thing.</p>
<p>The Reformation gained much from the use of popular
hymn-tunes, and the Socialists seem determined to gain by similar
means a similar hold upon the people.&nbsp; However, they must
not be too sanguine about the result.&nbsp; The walls of Thebes
rose up to the sound of music, and Thebes was a very dull city
indeed.</p>
<p>We really must protest against Mr. Matthews&rsquo; efforts to
confuse the poetry of Piccadilly with the poetry of
Parnassus.&nbsp; To tell us, for instance, that Mr. Austin
Dobson&rsquo;s verse &lsquo;has not the condensed clearness nor
the incisive vigor of Mr. Locker&rsquo;s&rsquo; is really too bad
even for Transatlantic criticism.&nbsp; Nobody who lays claim to
the slightest knowledge of literature and the forms of literature
should ever bring the two names into conjunction.</p>
<p>Mr. Dobson has produced work that is absolutely classical in
its exquisite beauty of form.&nbsp; Nothing more artistically
perfect in its way than the <i>Lines to a Greek Girl</i> has been
written in our time.&nbsp; This little poem will be remembered in
literature as long as <i>Thyrsis</i> is remembered, and
<i>Thyrsis</i> will never be forgotten.&nbsp; Both have that note
of distinction that is so rare in these days of violence,
exaggeration and <!-- page 213--><a name="page213"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 213</span>rhetoric.&nbsp; Of course, to
suggest, as Mr. Matthews does, that Mr. Dobson&rsquo;s poems
belong to &lsquo;the literature of power&rsquo; is
ridiculous.&nbsp; Power is not their aim, nor is it their
effect.&nbsp; They have other qualities, and in their own
delicately limited sphere they have no contemporary rivals; they
have none even second to them.</p>
<p>The heroine is a sort of well-worn Becky Sharp, only much more
beautiful than Becky, or at least than Thackeray&rsquo;s
portraits of her, which, however, have always seemed to me rather
ill-natured.&nbsp; I feel sure that Mrs. Rawdon Crawley was
extremely pretty, and I have never understood how it was that
Thackeray could caricature with his pencil so fascinating a
creation of his pen.</p>
<p>A critic recently remarked of Adam Lindsay Gordon that through
him Australia had found her first fine utterance in song.&nbsp;
This, however, is an amiable error.&nbsp; There is very little of
Australia in Gordon&rsquo;s poetry.&nbsp; His heart and mind and
fancy were always preoccupied with memories and dreams of England
and such culture as England gave him.&nbsp; He owed nothing to
the land of his adoption.&nbsp; Had he stayed at home he would
have done much better work.</p>
<p>That Australia, however, will some day make amends by
producing a poet of her own we cannot doubt, and for him there
will be new notes to sound and new wonders to tell of.</p>
<p>The best that we can say of him is that he wrote imperfectly
in Australia those poems that in England he might have made
perfect.</p>
<p>Judges, like the criminal classes, have their lighter
moments.</p>
<p><!-- page 214--><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>There seems to be some curious connection between piety
and poor rhymes.</p>
<p>The South African poets, as a class, are rather behind the
age.&nbsp; They seem to think that &lsquo;Aurora&rsquo; is a very
novel and delightful epithet for the dawn.&nbsp; On the whole
they depress us.</p>
<p>The only original thing in the volume is the description of
Mr. Robert Buchanan&rsquo;s &lsquo;grandeur of mind.&rsquo;&nbsp;
This is decidedly new.</p>
<p>Dr. Cockle tells us that M&uuml;llner&rsquo;s <i>Guilt</i> and
<i>The Ancestress</i> of Grillparzer are the masterpieces of
German fate-tragedy.&nbsp; His translation of the first of these
two masterpieces does not make us long for any further
acquaintance with the school.&nbsp; Here is a specimen from the
fourth act of the fate-tragedy.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">SCENE VIII.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Elvira</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Hugo</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elvira</span> (<i>after long silence</i>,
<i>leaving the harp</i>, <i>steps to Hugo</i>, <i>and seeks his
gaze</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hugo</span> (<i>softly</i>).&nbsp; Though
I made sacrifice of thy sweet life, the Father has
forgiven.&nbsp; Can the wife&mdash;forgive?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elvira</span> (<i>on his

<p><span class="smcap">Hugo</span> (<i>with all the warmth of
love</i>).&nbsp; Dear wife!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elvira</span> (<i>after a pause</i>, <i>in
deep sorrow</i>).&nbsp; Must it be so, beloved one?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hugo</span> (<i>sorry to have betrayed
himself</i>).&nbsp; What?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Renaissance had for its object the development of great
personalities.&nbsp; The perfect freedom of the temperament in
matters of art, the perfect freedom of the intellect in
intellectual matters, the full development of the individual,
were the things it aimed at.&nbsp; As we study its history we
find it full of great anarchies.&nbsp; It solved no political or
social problems; it did not seek to solve them.&nbsp; The ideal
of the &lsquo;Grand Si&egrave;cle,&rsquo; and of Richelieu, in
whom <!-- page 215--><a name="page215"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 215</span>the forces of that great age were
incarnate, was different.&nbsp; The ideas of citizenship, of the
building up of a great nation, of the centralization of forces,
of collective action, of ethnic unity of purpose, came before the
world.</p>
<p>The creation of a formal tradition upon classical lines is
never without its danger, and it is sad to find the provincial
towns of France, once so varied and individual in artistic
expression, writing to Paris for designs and advice.&nbsp; And
yet, through Colbert&rsquo;s great centralizing scheme of State
supervision and State aid, France was the one country in Europe,
and has remained the one country in Europe, where the arts are
not divorced from industry.</p>
<p>Hawthorne re-created for us the America of the past with the
incomparable grace of a very perfect artist, but Mr. Bret
Harte&rsquo;s emphasized modernity has, in its own sphere, won
equal, or almost equal, triumphs.</p>
<p>It is pleasant to come across a heroine [Bret Harte&rsquo;s
<i>Cressy</i>] who is not identified with any great cause, and
represents no important principle, but is simply a wonderful
nymph from American backwoods, who has in her something of
Artemis, and not a little of Aphrodite.</p>
<p>It is always a pleasure to come across an American poet who is
not national, and who tries to give expression to the literature
that he loves rather than to the land in which he lives.&nbsp;
The Muses care so little for geography!</p>
<p>Blue-books are generally dull reading, but Blue-books on
Ireland have always been interesting.&nbsp; They form the record
of one of the great tragedies <!-- page 216--><a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>of modern
Europe.&nbsp; In them England has written down her indictment
against herself and has given to the world the history of her
shame.&nbsp; If in the last century she tried to govern Ireland
with an insolence that was intensified by race hatred and
religious prejudice, she has sought to rule her in this century
with a stupidity that is aggravated by good intentions.</p>
<p>Like most penmen he [Froude] overrates the power of the
sword.&nbsp; Where England has had to struggle she has been
wise.&nbsp; Where physical strength has been on her side, as in
Ireland, she has been made unwieldy by that strength.&nbsp; Her
own strong hands have blinded her.&nbsp; She has had force but no
direction.</p>
<p>There are some who will welcome with delight the idea of
solving the Irish question by doing away with the Irish
people.&nbsp; There are others who will remember that Ireland has
extended her boundaries, and that we have now to reckon with her
not merely in the Old World but in the New.</p>
<p>Plastic simplicity of outline may render for us the visible
aspect of life; it is different when we come to deal with those
secrets which self-consciousness alone contains, and which
self-consciousness itself can but half reveal.&nbsp; Action takes
place in the sunlight, but the soul works in the dark.&nbsp;
There is something curiously interesting in the marked tendency
of modern poetry to become obscure.&nbsp; Many critics, writing
with their eyes fixed on the masterpieces of past literature,
have ascribed this tendency to wilfulness and to
affectation.&nbsp; Its origin is rather to be found in the
complexity of the new problems, and in the fact that
self-consciousness is <!-- page 217--><a name="page217"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 217</span>not yet adequate to explain the
contents of the Ego.&nbsp; In Mr. Browning&rsquo;s poems, as in
life itself, which has suggested, or rather necessitated, the new
method, thought seems to proceed not on logical lines, but on
lines of passion.&nbsp; The unity of the individual is being
expressed through its inconsistencies and its
contradictions.&nbsp; In a strange twilight man is seeking for
himself, and when he has found his own image, he cannot
understand it.&nbsp; Objective forms of art, such as sculpture
and the drama, sufficed one for the perfect presentation of life;
they can no longer so suffice.</p>
<p>As he is not a genius he, naturally, behaves admirably on
every occasion.</p>
<p>Certainly dialect is dramatic.&nbsp; It is a vivid method of
re-creating a past that never existed.&nbsp; It is something
between &lsquo;A Return to Nature&rsquo; and &lsquo;A Return to
the Glossary.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is so artificial that it is really
na&iuml;ve.&nbsp; From the point of view of mere music, much may
be said for it.&nbsp; Wonderful diminutives lend new notes of
tenderness to the song.&nbsp; There are possibilities of fresh
rhymes, and in search for a fresh rhyme poets may be excused if
they wander from the broad highroad of classical utterance into
devious byways and less-trodden paths.&nbsp; Sometimes one is
tempted to look on dialect as expressing simply the pathos of
provincialisms, but there is more in it than mere
mispronunciation.&nbsp; With that revival of an antique form,
often comes the revival of an antique spirit.&nbsp; Through
limitations that are sometimes uncouth, and always narrow, comes
Tragedy herself; and though she may stammer in her utterance, and
deck herself in cast-off weeds and trammelling raiment, still we
must hold ourselves in readiness to accept her, so <!-- page
218--><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>rare are her visits to us now, so rare her presence in
an age that demands a happy ending from every play, and that sees
in the theatre merely a source of amusement.</p>
<p>There is a great deal to be said in favour of reading a novel
backwards.&nbsp; The last page is, as a rule, the most
interesting, and when one begins with the catastrophe or the
<i>d&eacute;no&ucirc;ment</i> one feels on pleasant terms of
equality with the author.&nbsp; It is like going behind the
scenes of a theatre.&nbsp; One is no longer taken in, and the
hairbreadth escapes of the hero and the wild agonies of the
heroine leave one absolutely unmoved.</p>
<p>He has every form of sincerity except the sincerity of the
artist, a defect that he shares with most of our popular
writers.</p>
<p>On the whole <i>Primavera</i> is a pleasant little book, and
we are glad to welcome it.&nbsp; It is charmingly &lsquo;got
up,&rsquo; and undergraduates might read it with advantage during
lecture hours.</p>

(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
